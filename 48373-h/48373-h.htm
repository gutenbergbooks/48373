<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</h2>

<p>Embarrassed readers, who delight in books
of travel, whether for the recreation or the
useful information they afford, are not relieved
of their difficulty when the title of the work,
instead of indicating the nature of the subject,
only presents an enigma for them to solve.
How, for instance, is the reader to gauge
the nature of the contents of “Voyage en
Zigzag?” It might mean the itinerary of
some crooked course among the Alps, or,
perhaps, the log-book of a yacht chopping
about the Channel, or the record of anything
but a straightforward journey. Again, “By
Land and Sea” might simply be the diary
of a holiday trip from London to Paris, or a
<i>réchauffé</i> of impressions of a “globe-trotter,”
who went to see what everybody talked
about that he also might talk about what he
had seen. Then there are a host of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
such as “Travels West,” “The Land of the
North Wind”&mdash;which one has to discover
vaguely by ascertaining first where it does not
blow,&mdash;“Loin de Paris,” “Dans les Nuages,”
“On Blue Water;” all of which might be
strictly applicable to the metropolitan area if
the water were only just a little bluer. But
“Voyage Autour de ma Femme” is still less
intelligible. Is it a book of travel at all, or
only a romance, or a <i>comédie-vaudeville</i>? It
may not be a <i>fantaisie</i> like “Voyage Autour de
ma Chambre,” nor even the record of a journey
necessarily performed within four walls, for&mdash;though
I have not looked at the book&mdash;it may
be the narrative of an unsentimental journey,
in which the tourist had taken a holiday trip
all around picturesque Europe and his wife,
leaving her at home; or it may be a sentimental
journey as touching as Sterne’s&mdash;a
kind of circular tour <i>en petit</i>, circumscribed by
the ordinary length of the apron-string; in
which event, a very subjective turn of the
<i>impressions de voyage</i> would be evident; and
consequently would not suit readers who
decidedly prefer to regard what is presented
from the objective side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
The reader will naturally discover from the
title of this book the traveller’s course, but
he will at the same time, no doubt, desire to
know something of the character of the book.</p>

<p>It may gratify him to be told that essentially
it is a personal narrative, that cannot fail to
interest those who like in a book of travel
a tale of life full of incident and adventure:
it is one in which his sympathies will be
awakened and sustained in following the
traveller in his movements from day to day
and from place to place, his imagination
being vividly stirred by the illusion that the
participator is, as it were, in the changing
scenes and events passing before his eyes
like the tableaux of a diorama. And yet it
must not be supposed, because the writer’s
chief object has been to give an interesting
personal narrative, that it is deficient in useful
information: far from it; but, instead of
overcharging his book with minute details, he
has seized the more salient features of men and
things. These are presented from his own
point of view as the result of intelligent
observation or discriminating hearsay.</p>

<p>The traveller, who is evidently a most genial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
companion, passes lightly and rapidly over
the well-known route from Paris to St. Petersburg
and Moscow in the short space of thirty
pages. After taking a glance at the wonders
of the Kremlin and the monastery of Troïtsa,
probably the richest religious community in
the world, with its heaps of precious pearls and
various gems, he passes on to the famous mart
of Nijni-Novgorod, along the frozen Oka and
the Volga, through the country of the Votiaks,
and across the Ural Mountains into Siberia.
Posting at full gallop over the snowy way,
sleeping, living altogether in fact, in his sledge
(for the luxury of beds is unknown in Siberian
hotels), he falls in with a series of adventures,
sometimes amusing and sometimes even tragic,
in his progress over that vast territory that
presents so many strange races, and, in winter,
so many remarkable scenes. At one time he
is in imminent peril of being lost in a snowstorm
on the steppe of Omsk, and at another
on the frozen surface of the Baikal. He makes
an excursion on the way amid the wild
Kirghiz, gets a peep at the life of the Polish
exiles, and at the gold miners and the people
of Irkutsk in their amusements and occupations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
The grand scenes of nature, particularly at
this season, are all duly depicted with the
emotion of one alive to the beautiful and
sublime: the wonderful atmospheric effects of
light at a very low temperature, the novel and
changing aspects of the steppes; the startling
spectacle of the frozen Angara and Lake
Baikal, the grotesque aspect of the snow-capped
forests, and then, later, the picturesque,
verdant valleys of China. In the course of his
journey through Mongolia, he enables us to
get a glimpse at those strange people the
Mongols, their tent life, their city of tents,
their incessant prayer-turning as a chief
occupation, and the fearful character of some
of their ceremonies. Then, after a caravan
journey of eighteen days across the trackless
Desert of Gobi, he arrives at the great Wall of
China, and finally at Pekin, where he contemplates
its curiosities, its works of art, its
people, their institutions and their daily life.</p>

<p>Having thus given an outline of the book
and its contents for the reader’s guidance, I
will proceed to explain why I have thought
it advisable to depart from a close imitation
throughout of the original, and to present, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
fact, a modified version rather than a strict
translation.</p>

<p>The style of the original, though simple and
unadorned, is frequently slipshod; and the
author&mdash;contrary to many French travellers,
who often make, and perhaps still oftener
attempt to make, the subject of their narrative
a vehicle for epigram and sparkling and
spirited diction&mdash;has evidently thought more
of conveying a truthful picture to the reader,
than of the mode of expression by which this
could be most effectively done. In many novel
and interesting descriptions, for example, the
effect they are capable of producing is almost
wholly lost through the want of a more just
co-ordination of parts and subordination of
minor details, and, occasionally, through the
want of sufficient expansion, lest the reader
should not have time to contemplate and
realize a quick succession of fleeting images.</p>

<p>These, consequently, are some of the chief
points I have attempted to correct; though in
making the attempt, I hope I may not have
exposed myself to an unpleasant suspicion, in
the first place, of having assumed too much
assurance in undertaking uninvited to revise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
the writing of another, and, in the next place,
in certain <i>tableaux</i>, which would be unattractive
if obscure or colourless, of having indulged in
a taste for fine writing, when the sole object
has been to place the matter before the reader
as lucidly and vividly as possible.</p>

<p>But it will probably more concern the reader
to be assured that the truthfulness of these
descriptions, such as represented by the traveller,
has not been distorted in this manner
of treating them. On this point he may
readily satisfy himself on taking the trouble to
compare some of them with those in the
original edition. He will find, I hope, that my
work has not been in vain, and that I have
contributed something towards rendering more
attractive this interesting narrative, chiefly
relating to that land over which Madame
Cottin, Xavier de Maistre, and other writers
have thrown a glow of romance.</p>

<p class="center"><i>En route</i> by rail&mdash;Berlin&mdash;Annoyances at the Russian Custom
House&mdash;First aspect of European Russia&mdash;An evening on
the banks of the Neva.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I had quite made up my mind to pass
my winter in Siberia and to proceed in the
following spring to Pekin by Mongolia and
the Desert of Gobi, my friends, hearing of
my project, were incredulous of the steadfastness
of my resolution; they shrugged their
shoulders, quivering, perhaps at the prospect
of frost-nipped limbs, and wondered what
could induce me to quit the comfortably
warmed salons at this season merely to brave
the boreal blasts of so rigorous a climate.
So far as it concerned me, however, this
anticipatory cold was not at all catching, for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
indeed, my resolution was then too firmly set to
be shaken by a quivering void of sympathetic
influence, or to yield to the allurements of
the most inviting-Parisian <i>cercle</i> or boudoir.</p>

<p>Having therefore already well considered
my project, I had decided on attempting to
accomplish it for this reason: I had seen
Syria and Nubia, lands of the Sun, in their
full-blown summer radiance and glory, and
I now longed to gaze on Siberia, the region
of snow and ice, in its wondrous winter garb.
When I am in the humour for a tour, I like
to visit countries in their typical season, just
as one likes to see a man in the exercise of his
proper vocation. There is, undoubtedly, a
feeling of satisfaction in contemplating the
animate or inanimate world merely in its
habitual phases, in so far as these are the
normal and appropriate expression of a condition
of established law and order&mdash;the
harmonies of nature as well as the moral
fitness of things. Siberia, as it is pictured
to our imagination, is vividly associated with
the stirring incidents of a rigorous arctic
winter; it is in this, its most characteristic
aspect, that we delight to regard it and muse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
over it; moreover, in winter only is it so
remarkably dissimilar from the nature we are
accustomed to see in milder and more genial
climates, and in this season alone, with its
mighty ice-bound rivers and boundless snow-capped
forests, does it present to the wondering
eye of the stranger the interest and
attractiveness of a striking novelty.</p>

<p>I was in excellent spirits from the exhilarating
anticipation of so much adventure,
as the reader may imagine, and, busy with
final preparations, my friends seeing me thus
occupied, amused me with their diverse questions
and suggestions. Every one puts
questions in his own way according to his
habitual ideas or occupation. The doctor
with a grave look asks, “Are you sure your
constitution is robust enough to bear so much
cold?” the druggist, whether you have a
good supply of quinine or chilblain ointment,
or somebody’s magic pills&mdash;some comprehensive
remedy for all human weaknesses, corporeal
and mental, excepting, of course, the
incurable one of belief in its efficacy; then
ladies suggest a good supply of warm worsted
stockings and knitted comforters; then others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
inquire whether you have a passport duly
<i>visé</i>, a six-shot revolver, maps, a telescope,
letters of credit, a belt for gold, and I really
don’t know with what they would not considerately
provide me. Some perhaps might
have gone so far as to suggest a warming
pan; and for my part, I think that a warming
pan would not have been the least useful
article suggested, inasmuch as it might serve
as a stewing pan, and then I should be assured
of a hot supper and a warm bed; then in inns
its sonorous capacity might supply the want
of bells, and on a journey serve to scare away
the wolves, and finally, having no further use
for this accommodating vade mecum, I might
sell it in Mongolia, a land of honey, for a
purpose to which, I have heard, it is sometimes
applied in England, that is for swarming
bees with its deep musical note, and this
failing, at all events, dispose of it in China,
on taking out the handle, as the latest novelty
in gongs in <i>articles de Paris</i>.</p>

<p>But not one of my friends, not even the
druggist, who sells <i>mort aux mouches</i> and other
insect killers, thought of the <i>chasses</i> one is
occasionally, though not so often now, obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
to devote himself to in foreign inns; probably
they were not lovers of the chase, at least of
such small game; but when one has once been
<i>bien mangé</i>, the <i>piqures</i> leave their marks on the
memory when they have been long effaced elsewhere,
and not knowing what sport I might fall
in with, I took care to secure the completeness
of my <i>gréement de chasse</i>, and having at last
made all my arrangements, I was ready to start.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the 25th of October, 1873,
at eight in the morning, I left the Gare du
Nord, and no sooner had I taken my seat
than inquiries recommenced in another form
by a talkative traveller. This traveller was a
Belgian, and Belgians are generally loquacious
and free in making acquaintances. “Where
are you going, monsieur?” said he. “As
for me, I am going as far as Cologne; it is a
very long journey, you know, and I like to
have some one to talk to, to pass away these
twelve long hours in a carriage.” “And
so am I going to Cologne,” I replied. “Oh!
you are going to Cologne, are you? Is it
to buy horses? That is what I am going there
for,” he explained. “I am accustomed to buy
my horses in Prussia.” “No,” I said, “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
not going to Cologne for that.” “What for,
then?” “Well, it is to start again from
there, for I go to Berlin.” “Oh! you are
going to Berlin? Why then are you going
to Berlin? Nobody goes there, neither
tourists nor men of business.” “I go there
to start again, for I go from there to St.
Petersburg.” These questions succeeded one
another in this way from stage to stage, till
the moment we had finished the tour of the
world. His simple Flemish countenance then
took a curious expression of droll astonishment.
He could say no more till after the
lapse of some moments, and then it was to
exclaim, opening his large mouth as wide as
possible and vigorously thumping the cushion
with his heavy fist, “Oh! Ah! Then you
are really going round the world. Dear me!
round the world!” “Yes, almost,” I replied,
smiling, “and therefore when I want horses
I must buy them elsewhere than in Cologne.”</p>

<p>As soon as Cologne and the Rhine are
passed, a little favoured spot of this dull
country&mdash;at least, as it appears to the traveller
<i>en route</i>&mdash;you traverse an endless plain,
neither picturesque nor interesting. Berlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
redeems with no artistic beauty its sterile
situation. But a Parisian could not be expected
to find much attraction in Berlin, and
accordingly I found it very dull. Its streets
are badly paved; enormous gutters, separating
the roadway from the pavement, expose
carriages to danger and exhale noxious odours,
filled as they are with filthy water and refuse
of every kind.</p>

<p>What strikes one in this city is a general
aspect of gloominess. They have tried in all
the public buildings to imitate the Grecian
Doric, and have only too well succeeded in it.
I do not understand at all why the Prussians
have adopted this cold style, more sepulchral
even than the Egyptian, under a sky so dull,
and almost as foggy as that of Old England.
In the places of amusement, in the interior of
the Opera for instance, they have replaced
the Doric style with the Corinthian, that is to
say, mourning with half-mourning. The
national colours, white and black, profusely
distributed everywhere, complete its funereal
character.</p>

<p>The finest avenue, Unter den Linden, leads
from the Museum to the exterior promenades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
but the colour of the houses bordering this
boulevard spoils the effect; it suggested a
mixture of iron and saffron or something like
the sickly hue of jaundice. The general
impression is anything but cheerful. One is
almost disposed to say to every one he meets:
“Frère, il faut mourir!” but I said to myself,
“Il faut partir,” and, after a short halt, I
accordingly took my departure.</p>

<p>The following day the express train, without
any incident worthy of note, took me to the
Russian frontier.</p>

<p>Though there are custom houses at the
frontiers of every civilized state, their character
and methods of proceeding have not, in spite
of the levelling tendencies of railways, yet
arrived at much approach to uniformity; and
since these characteristics differ widely from
China to Peru, they frequently give some sign
of the political and social status of the people
into whose country one enters.</p>

<p>At the custom house of this colossal empire
of Russia, with a national budget so overcharged,
the treasury is especially solicitous
of filling the imperial coffers. Money is sorely
needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
The stranger there must first prove his
identity by producing his passport duly <i>visé</i>
at the consulates of all the places he has passed.
The passport is returned to him, bearing a
word written on the back. This word leaves
every uninitiated traveller in complete ignorance
of its meaning or object; it is written
in Russian characters, and, moreover, badly
written in a language which, in conformity
with good taste, one is expected not to know.</p>

<p>When I received my passport marked with
the mystic word, my embarrassment was painful.
I walked up and down the waiting room,
showing the word to every one I met. They
all looked at me with astonishment, and kept
clear of me without offering any explanation.
I, at last, heard some one speaking French
near me; it was a gentleman whose moustaches
of immoderate length and dark whiskers
white at the tips, something like the fur of the
blue fox, indicated him to be of Northern
nationality. I hastened to be enlightened,
and at once learnt that this important word
was the name of the officer appointed to
examine my baggage. After some difficulty,
I found the functionary, who, fortunately, spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
French. “Monsieur,” he said, “qu’avez-vous
à déclarer?” “Rien,” I promptly replied,
with all the freedom of innocence; “what I
bring with me is for my personal use, and if
some of the packages appear to you very
bulky, it is because I am on a very long, a
very distant journey.” “Be good enough to
open them.” I accordingly began, feeling
assured that everything would go on well and
soon end. “It is my personal clothing,” I
explained; “there is nothing but clothes in
this trunk. Here is a pair of trousers that
seems new; I have had it these three years.
It looks, however, new; that is to my credit;
you see, I do not wear out my clothes much,”
I remarked merrily. “But,” he rejoined, “it
seems too new; we will weigh it; this will be
paid for.” My mortification was about to
begin. He commenced putting into the scales
all the clothing which he considered had not
been worn. “What are these?” “They
are memorandum books.” “Is there anything
written in them?” “Nothing yet,” and then
they also go into the scales. But he was not
disposed to end there; far from it; I was
obliged to open the chest I had got packed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Paris with the greatest care, containing my
sporting equipment and many things for
use only in Siberia. Perceiving that he was
inexorable in his determination to turn out
everything, I entreated him to put the case,
just as it was, into the scales, preferring to
pay more to having the contents turned upside
down in the greatest disorder after they had
been so artistically arranged. But I was much
deceived, for this gentleman was too much of
a Cossack to forego the pleasure of examining
Parisian objects. Everything was turned out,
and, if possible, inside out, and put into the
scales. I was enraged.</p>

<p>In the midst of this intolerable annoyance,
there was for me a gleam of malicious satisfaction.
I had brought with me an enormous
box of vermin-killer in powder, which was
considered to be invaluable for my long journey
through Asia. The box could not easily be
opened; far from it. The officer tried in vain
for some time, but at last, the cover yielding
suddenly to his efforts, the powder was violently
flung into his face, penetrating into his eyes,
his nostrils, and mouth, and completely covering
his coat. “What is this?” he demanded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
“A very violent poison,” I replied, with an
affectation of terror, to add to his discomfiture,
which had due effect. He turned pale, and,
at once, fixed the duty on my effects at the
highest possible rate. But I had some unexpected
sport with large game, and, my revenge
having afforded me full satisfaction, I drew
from my pocket my louis d’or.</p>

<p>But, alas! Russia, the country that produces
at present so much gold, is the one where it
has the least currency. I was obliged to go
and change my twenty-franc pieces for paper
roubles; and thus I paid at this custom house
more than a hundred francs, merely to pass
my old clothes&mdash;this sum being as much as
they were worth&mdash;and my memorandum books,
which I could not make up my mind to
abandon, because they were my only companions
to be entrusted with my <i>impressions de
voyage</i>.</p>

<p>Before getting into the train, I observed a
newsvendor on the platform. “Have you the
<i>Figaro</i>?” I asked. “Yes, sir.” “How
much?” “Thirty kopecks” (one shilling).
“Then give me a newspaper of your own
country printed in French.” “Here is one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
sir, the <i>Journal de St. Pétersbourg</i>.” “How
much?” “Fifteen kopecks.” “But why
is it so dear, printed in Russia?” “It is,
sir, because here there are enormous duties
on the manufacture of paper.” This kind of
tax, in my opinion, is, for one thing, to be fully
appreciated. The Russians should thus be
guarded against a propensity for scribbling,
which, alas! is so rampant in France. And
then again, when universal suffrage is to
appear in Russia, who knows whether the
exorbitant price of paper will not hinder
the candidates from distributing the voting
papers, and the electors from procuring them
at their own expense? The exercise of this
new power will then be the cause of a fresh
charge and become consequently an obstacle.
Such a state of things perhaps will cause
universal suffrage to succumb and disappear&mdash;an
institution apparently just and attractive
in theory, but amusingly droll in practice to
those who have witnessed its working, especially
in the country districts. This first
experience reconciled me with the administration
of this vast country, almost even with its
custom house, and I climbed up into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
carriage, where two stoves, though it had not
yet commenced to freeze, kept up a tropical
heat. There I installed myself in one of the
immense easy seats with which it was furnished,
and which was transformed at night,
with the aid of a mechanical arrangement, into
a kind of bed, where one may be tolerably
comfortable, and there I waited the signal of
departure, prepared to observe the aspect of
the country through which I was about to pass.</p>

<p>The part of Russia between Wilna and St.
Petersburg is simply melancholy. When I
passed over it, the absence of snow, of sun,
and leaves on the trees, rendered this character,
which is proper to it, still more striking.
Unlimited forests, that are no longer copse
and not yet arrived at full growth, and as
impenetrable as a jungle, especially in autumn,
from the swampy nature of the soil; a long
undulating range of land, of an outline the
ocean would assume in the monstrous swell
of a tempest, sending back the horizon to an
enormous distance; the appearance of a few
habitations, at long intervals, and whose
presence at all in such a spot suggests utter
desolation more than absolute solitude:&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
is what is presented to the traveller on entering
Russia, immensity, impenetrability, and silent
gloom.</p>

<p>It is true that autumn is the least favourable
season for visiting Russia; it is, in a certain
way, the period of inactivity for the whole
race, a people scattered over an immense
space, whose special character needs a rapid
and continual locomotion. The land in autumn
becomes too swampy for wheeled carriages,
and travelling in sledges has not yet commenced.
Soon, however, the snow, falling
probably in abundance, will permit the Russians
their favourite mode of travelling; and
the intense cold, dissipating the clouds, will
give to its white mantle unparalleled purity
and brilliancy.</p>

<p>We will hasten to arrive at St. Petersburg,
of which, however, as well as of Moscow, I will
say but little, because I have to describe regions
more remote and much less known. When
one has a long journey before him, he should
not linger at the first stages, for fear of feeling
too sensibly the difficulties of the enterprise,
and consequently of being tempted to abandon
it in spite of a brave resolution at the outset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
I alighted at the Hôtel de France, and,
almost immediately, went out afoot. It was
six in the evening and quite dark. A mild and
refreshing temperature was inviting to a walk.
The sky was serene, and the moon shone
brilliantly. It was one of those fine evenings
described by Joseph de Maistre, although we
were still in November. Chance led me
towards the Neva, and I was much delighted,
for, from the bridge of boats thrown across it,
I was able to contemplate a spectacle truly
magnificent. It is not a river, but rather an
inlet of the sea. Four or five times wider
than the Garonne at Bordeaux, this piece of
water makes a bend in the middle of the city;
and along its banks is exposed the principal
architectural magnificence of St. Petersburg.
The Emperor’s palace, the Senate, the Fortress,
the Hermitage, the Academy of Fine
Arts, are all along its banks, as well as an
immense number of churches, each surmounted
with five or six Byzantine domes.</p>

<p>At the moment I was there, the moon’s
rays were reflected from all these gilded domes,
and again these glittering beams were flashed
like dazzling fireworks from the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the water; the gilded cupola of the Cathedral
St. Isaac rose majestically above the others,
and surpassed them in splendour. Black
barges, resembling somewhat, at this hour of
the night, Venetian gondolas, passed to and
fro, leaving their luminous trails glittering on
the surface of the water. The great mass of
water of Lake Ladoga was gliding onward
in its full flood with rapidity, but without
noise, for nothing opposed its passage. The
bells, which gave an idea of enormous size
from their deep, solemn, and prolonged tone,
alone broke the religious silence of the scene
by the call to prayer. It was grand, solemn,
and inspiring. This night at St. Petersburg,
God revealed Himself to man by the splendour
of the heavens and the mystery of the hour,
and man’s thoughts were drawn to God by the
imposing towering of His temples and the
awe-inspiring sound of the bells.</p>

<p>Though I was much moved by this scene
and its associations, I knew I could not adequately
enjoy Russia in its aspect of the mild
season. A little later, however, the Neva
would be arrested in its course by the frost,
the domes of the churches, as well as the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
everywhere, would be dressed in a thick mantle
of snow, and then I should no longer behold
this country as it now was, but buried under
its winter shroud. I remained therefore long
contemplating this spectacle, the real beauty
of which was enhanced in my imagination by
the reflection that it was to be but of short
duration.</p>

<span class="subhead">ST. PETERSBURG TO MOSCOW.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Letters of recommendation for Siberia&mdash;M. Pfaffius, frontier
commissary at Kiachta&mdash;Russian music&mdash;Arrival at
Moscow.</p></blockquote>

<p>During my sojourn at St. Petersburg, I went
of course, and more than once, to see the
curiosities with which the city is filled, but
it was necessary to remember that I had set
out for a much longer journey, and that my
chief occupation at St. Petersburg was to
search for a <i>compagnon de voyage</i>. With this
object, I availed myself of all the letters of
recommendation I had obtained in Paris,
hoping thereby to secure the useful as well
as agreeable society either of a tourist or
of a functionary returning to his post in
Eastern Siberia.</p>

<p>In the first <i>réunions</i> where I had the honour
to be invited, I invariably spoke of my intended
journey, hoping thereby to find a travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
companion, but in doing so, I was always
answered with a frown or met with a deaf
ear.</p>

<p>The reason was this: at St. Petersburg,
it is not in good taste to travel in the direction
of the East. The inhabitants of this city of
pleasure seem to regret their origin; this
society, so fastidious and refined, appears
really to fear being still taken for a horde of
barbarians. Women in the highest social
rank have said to me sometimes: “Whatever
I may do or say, you will nevertheless have
your own opinion of me; you will regard me
as a Cossack.” Everything associated with
Asia is in disfavour, and, perhaps, those who
exaggerate the sentiment would willingly
cede Siberia to the Chinese Government, in
order to have nothing in common with the
East. To speak French is indispensable;
when you are French and are received in
society in St. Petersburg, it is surprising to
see how much France is <i>à la mode</i>: French is
habitually spoken, and read in newspapers
and books; the <i>cuisine</i> is French as well as
the costumes, and so are many of the plays
at the theatres. It is quite the <i>ton</i> to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
arrived from Paris, Luchon, or Trouville, and
to have brought the latest <i>cancans</i> from the
<i>boudoirs à la mode</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the frost appeared, I began
busying myself with the arrangements for my
journey. I was aided in this difficult task
by M. Bartholdy, then <i>chargé d’affaires</i> at
the French Embassy. This obliging Frenchman
succeeded with the Imperial Government
in enabling me to traverse Siberia in a manner
somewhat official, and the ministers accordingly
gave me letters of recommendation to
the governors of the various provinces I was
about to visit.</p>

<p>I obtained also from M. Michaelof, the
contractor for the posting between Nijni-Novgorod
and Tumen, a circular order requiring
each postmaster on the route to
give me the best horses at the shortest
notice.</p>

<p>Many persons recommended me to their
friends in Siberia. In less than a fortnight I
was provided with thirty-two of these recommendations,
but I had not yet found either a
companion or a servant.</p>

<p>The frost, however, was becoming every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
day more severe. The thermometer varied
between 10° and 12° Centigrade below zero
(14° to 10° Fahr.).<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> See <a href="#note_1">note 1</a> at end of book.</p></div>

<p>The canal of the Moïka, which my windows
overlooked, was already half frozen; enormous
blocks of ice were drifting on the Neva; the
snow, though not yet very deep, fell often
enough to lead me to hope for sledging very
shortly. I was about to decide to start alone
for Moscow, when I received a letter from the
head of the Asiatic Government.</p>

<p>This letter informed me that the Russian
frontier commissary at Kiachta, M. Pfaffius,
was at St. Petersburg at the Hotel Démouth,
and was about to join his post.</p>

<p>Without losing a moment, I gathered up all
the letters, those even the addresses of which
I could not read, and hastened to the Hotel
Démouth.</p>

<p>I did not yet know what it was to travel
through Siberia; I had not the least idea
of many things that were required, nor
that so many things even were necessary, and
was therefore not a little surprised, on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
entry into M. Pfaffius’s apartment, at the sight
that there awaited me.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room lay on the floor a
heap of pillows, furs, mattresses, blankets, and
ropes. This was not all, for I soon perceived
also a loaf of sugar, felt boots, a bottle of
brandy, and bags and sacks of every shape
and size.</p>

<p>The functionary, wearing a ring on the
second finger of his right hand, a sign of his
office, was seated at table breakfasting. At
his side stood a Buriat servant, with half-Mongol,
half-Tartar features, clad in a <i>touloupe</i>
of offensive odour, watching his master’s
slightest gesture to satisfy the most trifling
desire. As soon as I appeared, the commissary
ordered a chair for me, but since
unluckily, perhaps through accident, no chair
could be found in the room, it was necessary
to search for one elsewhere. I was obliged to
remain standing some moments while rage
became apparent on the countenance of my
host, who, however, as I afterwards found, was
gentle enough. He became red and pale
alternately. When the Buriat returned he
rated him pretty smartly in words almost inarticulate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
though of perfectly intelligible
significance, and finished by raising his hand
to strike him.</p>

<p>Accustomed as I was to Oriental manners,
I anticipated the scene that was about to take
place, and took little notice of it, when, to my
great astonishment, the servant raised his
head, and looking sternly at the commissary,
addressed him in these simple words: “You
forget then, sir, that I am <i>a subject of the
Emperor</i>!”</p>

<p>This man well knew that an article of the
decree enfranchising the serfs interdicted landowners
and functionaries, under penalty of
disgrace and even imprisonment, from having
recourse to blows against any subject whomsoever
of the Emperor, whether naturalized
Russian or native of a conquered country,
like the Kirghiz, the Buriats, or the Samoyeds.</p>

<p>These words were sufficient, in fact, to cause
the lifted fist of the official to drop harmlessly
by his side. What passion, indeed, is there in
a Russian, when roused even to exasperation,
that would venture to offend against the will
of the Czar?</p>

<p>When this little scene had ended, M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Pfaffius became again perfectly calm and self-possessed,&mdash;quite
a man of the world. I
showed him my letters of recommendation.
As soon as his eye caught the seal of the Imperial
Ministry&mdash;and this for a Russian official
was much more than was required&mdash;he showed
me the highest consideration. One of these
letters was personally addressed to him. I was
accordingly from that moment his friend, and
we resolved to travel together.</p>

<p>The reader will learn, from what took place
later, that this plan was only partially carried
out, in consequence of my having made at last
an acquaintance at Moscow. Being unable
at this moment to anticipate the number of
travelling companions that subsequently presented
themselves, I regarded my commissary
as a great acquisition. He had to go to Kiew
before the organization of the sledging took
place. I allowed him to depart only after
every precaution taken to ensure our rendezvous,
and, filled with enthusiasm, I set out on
my <i>visites d’adieux</i>.</p>

<p>I will speak of one of them only, which took
place in a box of the Russian Opera, not so
much on account of the very agreeable people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
who had invited me there to see the Opera,
as on account of the character of the music
and the manner of the representation of which
I was a witness. It was the chef-d’œuvre of
Glinka&mdash;<i>Life for the Czar</i>.</p>

<p>Without, however, detaining the reader with
the details of the manner of the representation,
which probably would interest him but slightly,
I will give my impression of the character of
the music.</p>

<p>The Russians, who are not an inventive
people, have, however, a national music of a
kind special and original.</p>

<p>Those who appreciate French operas, even
plaintive, would feel little interest in listening
to long lamentations and mournful melodies,
so characteristic of this music. It may, however,
move very much amateurs of grave
music, especially in the country where it
originates.</p>

<p>The phrases of Glinka’s opera, gloomy and
lugubrious, as uniform as nature in Russia,
as profound as its horizons, succeed one
another monotonously without ever seeming
to reach a distinct solution. At the moment
when the impatient ear at last waits to dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
on the fundamental note, a renewed expression
of grief comes forth unexpectedly, and the
phrase is prolonged without changing its
character. I cannot better compare Glinka’s
inspirations than with the permanent efforts of
the sea to assume its desired repose in struggling
against the incessant succession of waves.
This music therefore is void of the attraction
of gaiety, and, on account of its uniformity,
does not give rise to lively emotions, but it
has all the charm of melancholy and vague
reverie.</p>

<p>The flow of soul seems to wander and
become bewildered and enervated in the prolonged
thrilling notes of this endless melody;
all the past comes back to the memory, and
when the last note dies away, one wakes up,
as if from a touching dream, with a tear
starting in the eye.</p>

<p>I had postponed my departure from day to
day, notwithstanding the snow that was falling
and the hard frost so favourable to my journey,
but having at last quitted the Russian capital,
my thoughts returned to it in this way. One
prefers, no doubt, the first enjoyment of a
pleasure to the mere remembrance of it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
yet, perhaps, one separates himself less willingly
from the souvenir than from the reality,
because he feels that when this prolonged
pleasure ends, it has vanished both from the
senses and the memory.</p>

<p>When I left St. Petersburg, it was the 20th
of November, and on the 21st, at ten o’clock
in the morning, in a frost of 24° Centigrade
(11° below zero Fahr.), I made my entry into
the holy city of Moscow.</p>

<p>The temperature I had to bear this day was
very moderate in comparison with that which I
subsequently experienced in Siberia; I could,
however, appreciate some of the effects produced
by intense cold. You feel that everything
shrinks, tightens, and contracts. The
horses that perspire, on account of the rapid
pace at which they are driven, have their coats
covered with congealed perspiration that
resembles a petrifaction. The drivers’ faces
are puffed, spongy, and repulsive-looking.
The sun, in the absence of snow, seems alone
to rejoice or enliven what it touches. Under
its caressing beams, the houses, with their
varied hues, assume a brighter and more joyous
aspect, that strikingly contrasts with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
hooded personages afoot. I took care at once
to provide myself with the usual winter
clothing of Russians. I bought goloshes to
march over the snow without suffering from
cold or humidity; a <i>bachelique</i>, a kind of hood
in camel hair to protect the ears and neck;
and, finally, a cloak of <i>jenotte</i>, a fur not at all
expensive and yet elegant.</p>

<p>The choice of fur is an important matter,
especially at Moscow, where one’s individual
value is appreciated by the value of the animal’s
skin he wears. There is indeed a Russian
proverb that seems to discredit this observation.
“On vous reçoit selon votre habit, et
l’on vous reconduit selon votre esprit.” But
this apophthegm rarely serves as a precept
in a society fond of showiness and imposing
magnificence&mdash;a society that is closed against
the most cultivated mind if the body be not
decked in the skins of certain beasts.</p>

Troïtsa&mdash;A travelling companion&mdash;Purchase of furs&mdash;Passage

<p>I cannot better compare the disposition of
the streets of Moscow than with that of the
series of concentric threads in a cobweb.
Straight streets parting from the Kremlin, as
a common centre, intersect all the circular
arteries, in such a way, that it is impossible to
lose one’s self in the city, notwithstanding its
immensity.</p>

<p>Each Russian city has its kremlin. It is
an enclosure that contains generally a fortress,
a residence for the Emperor, and one or many
churches. The Kremlin of Moscow is much
celebrated on account of its vastness, its
historical souvenirs, and the wealth of its
sanctuaries. It is relatively modern, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
been rebuilt since the conflagration of 1812.
One may still visit a little relic of the old
building. It would be difficult to say to what
style it belongs; there may be found there a
mixture of many of the Asiatic varieties, between
the Byzantine and those of the extreme East.
Walls of extraordinary thickness; a series of
little chambers, vaulted or rising in a point;
narrow windows, permitting only the penetration
of a mysterious light, sifted through
stained glass; low doors surmounted with a
Moorish arch; walls, gilt from the ceiling to
the floor, on which are drawn figures of saints,
having only the head and hands painted or
enamelled; here and there Chinese monsters;
doors opening occasionally to the height of the
first story, and consequently suspended stairs
to pass from one floor to another&mdash;this is the
ancient Kremlin. One wonders, on roving
through this intricate labyrinth, whether he is in
an oratory or a salon, in a place of amusement
or in a torture chamber of the Inquisition.
The new dwelling of the emperors is quite
different. Although of very doubtful taste,
it is at least in harmony, on account of its
vastness, with the empire of which it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
seat. Space has not been spared. The hall
of the throne is quite a steppe to traverse. Its
dimensions are monstrous. What was my
astonishment on finding there several statues
and portraits of the Great Napoleon! The
Russians, far from bearing any enmity towards
our military hero, like to render homage to
his glory. To admire thus genius, wherever it
may be found, even when the admirer has been
the victim, is at least the mark of a liberal
mind and high sentiments.</p>

<p>I had finished my first visit to the Kremlin,
and, muffled and wrapped in furs, I was being
comfortably driven to my hotel, musing carelessly
on the way, when my coachman suddenly
turned round, and with a silly smile,
lifted my fur cap, and at the same time raised
his own. Obtaining no intelligible explanation,
through my ignorance of the language,
I fancied myself the object of some practical
joke in which coachmen indulge, and, consequently,
being unable to rate him well as he
deserved, I subdued my rage and smiled also.
I demanded my cap, however, by gestures,
to which he responded with three bows, as
many signs of the cross, and sanctimoniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
smiled again. I was just going to recover my
property by force, when I perceived we were
under the Spasskoï gateway, and that every
one was bareheaded.</p>

<p>The proceeding was now intelligible: this
gate is surmounted with the picture of the
Virgin of Inverski, the favourite virgin of the
Muscovites, the miraculous virgin whose supernatural
power had been equal to arresting the
conflagration of the Kremlin&mdash;the conflagration
lighted by Rostopchine, a personage much less
popular in Russia than Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Nobody, therefore, should pass the Spasskoï
gate without lifting his hat. Old men relate that
a violent wind forced even the great French
conqueror to submit to this law when he
intended to pass it unobserved.</p>

<p>The Virgin of Inverski is invoked by everybody;
still she does not make herself so cheap
to everybody, for a widely spread custom consists
in vicarious visits by representations.</p>

<p>In order to obtain miraculous cures, they
send for the Virgin of the Assumption, and
more special favours, for the Virgin of Vladimir;
and when one goes on a long journey,
he generally prefers a facsimile of the Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of Kazan. But extraordinary circumstances
must exist to demand a visit from the Virgin
of Inverski.</p>

<p>When the metropolitan considers that a
family is worthy of such an honour, four
monks and two dignitaries of the Church
proceed to the Spasskoï gate in a carriage
with six horses. Every spectator bows low
and makes the sign of the cross as the picture
is lowered from its accustomed place, and
prostrates himself completely, in spite of the
snow and frost, at the moment it is installed in
the bottom of the carriage; the two priests
then place themselves on the box in front, the
monks act as drivers and footmen, and thus
they proceed to the privileged house, whose
members do not receive the honour of such a
visit without very liberal offerings.</p>

  <div class="caption">CARRIAGE OF THE VIRGIN OF INVERSKI.</div></div>

<p>The individual ritual practices in the streets,
on the promenade, and everywhere, and at all
hours, constitute certainly some of the special
characteristics of Moscow. One meets at
every step people kneeling and reciting
prayers, though nothing apparently calls for
the devotion. The worship of pictorial representations
is exaggerated almost to idolatry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
even by the more enlightened portion of the
community. But then the higher class, though
almost wholly Nihilistic, condescends to observe
these popular forms on the one hand,
merely through a servile deference to the
authority of the Emperor, and on the other, an
unwillingness to reproach by neglect the
superstition of the lower class.</p>

<p>The orthodox religion is well known to be
a faithful reproduction of the old Greek
worship of Constantinople. About the year
1000, the chief of the horde that was then to
become the embryo of the Russian nation&mdash;a
thorough barbarian in daring and cruelty, in
brute force and ungovernable impetuosity&mdash;constituted
himself the promulgator of the Greek
religion in the country subject to his rule.</p>

<p>This Vladimir&mdash;such was his name&mdash;hurled
defiance at all the neighbouring peoples, and
subjected to his will nearly the whole of the
actual limits of European Russia. He is
alleged to have had&mdash;if certain fabulous
chronicles may be trusted&mdash;five legitimate
wives, eight hundred concubines, and a multitude
of children, whom he sacrificed to the
gods. But just at the moment he was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
to sacrifice his first wife, the partner even of
his throne, he was seized with remorse.</p>

<p>Intent on forming into an entire nation all
the hordes he had conquered, he nevertheless
understood that this could only be accomplished
by means of a national religion.
With this object in view, he sent ambassadors
into different countries, in order to study their
respective religions, and these from their
reports enabled him to choose which seemed
to him the best. Mahomedanism is said to
have displeased him, because the Koran
forbade the use of wine, a precept that would
not have favoured his indulgence in this habit.
Romanism was rejected on account of the
celibacy of the priesthood, and especially on
account of the obedience it would exact towards
an authority other than his own. Judaism,
a religion without national coherence,
was not favourable to his project of becoming
the founder of a homogenous and solid empire.
The Greek worship, however, imposed on his
barbarian mind by the magnificence of its
ritual; he therefore adopted it, and Russia
became a Christian nation of the Eastern
Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Though its dogmas differ but little from those
of the Romish Church, the Russians have inherited
the old hatred of the Greeks towards
the Romans. They would willingly put into
practice the ancient injunction of the Byzantine
bishops at the time of the expedition of
Frederick against Jerusalem:&mdash;“To obtain
the remission of sins, the pilgrims must be
massacred and exterminated from the face
of the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Michaud.</p></div>

<p>They derive also from the devotees of the
ancient Church their idolatry, for the indulgence
in which these sacrificed their lives. They are
the true disciples of those Byzantines who, at
the time of the Latin conquest, overthrew with
rage a statue of Minerva, upbraiding her with
having called hither the barbarians, because
she looked towards the west with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>During my stay at Moscow, I visited the
monastery of Troïtsa, near this city. This
monastery was founded by St. Sergius in 1338.
It would be more correct to say that at this
time the pious hermit of the forest of Godorok<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
became a cenobite in imparting to a few
zealous souls like his own a taste for poverty
and the renunciation of all worldly things.
But inasmuch as the united resources of
these devotees were barely sufficient at first to
provide for them a shelter, the convent was not
constructed till later.</p>

<p>His fortune was indeed changed when St.
Sergius, at the moment of the great Mongolian
invasion, prevailed on Prince Dmitri to march
against the barbarians in the plains of the
Don. This prince having become victorious
over the fierce Mamaï, overloaded the new community
with presents. In 1393, Troïtsa was
partially pillaged and burnt by the Tartars,
and St. Sergius perished; but his body, recovered
as if by a miracle from the heap of
ruins, continued to be an object of veneration.
The czars, the princes, the boyards, successively
bestowed important largesses on the
convent, whose wealth then became legendary
in Russia. In the middle of the last century,
Troïtsa possessed, in addition to an almost
incredible heap of jewels, immense domains
and a hundred thousand peasants. Then even
the wealth of the monastery was estimated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
be over forty millions of pounds sterling. Its
fortifications, which still exist, defended it in
1609 against the Polish invasion, and sheltered
from danger the young czars John and Peter
Alexievitch during one of the revolts of the
Strelitz Imperial Guards. Besides the buildings
serving the community as habitations, it
surrounds with its walls nine churches, whose
riches excite the wonder rather than the admiration
of the stranger. All the painted and
enamelled portions of the representations of
saints are set around with rubies, emeralds,
topazes, and diamonds, of enormous size.
The tomb of St. Sergius is in gilded silver;
the canopy is of massive silver, and supported
by four columns also of silver. The chasubles,
worn by the priesthood in the exercise of their
worship, are covered with fifteen, eighteen,
and even twenty-one pounds of pearls. The
spectator is at first dazzled at the sight of so
much magnificence; but since all these things
are wonders only on account of their immense
value, one at last becomes indifferent to the
spectacle of a mere heap of precious things.
As other writers, more able, have already fully
described Troïtsa, I will not fatigue the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with further details. My guide led me to see
everything: the chapels, the treasury, where
may be seen <i>twenty gallons of fine pearls</i>, which
are consigned to a glass case, the authorities
not knowing what other use to make of them.
When I had seen all these treasures, my guide
led me to one of the outer doors and held out
his hand. This movement, I must admit,
embarrassed me, for after having visited the
monastery of Troïtsa, a donation of a thousand
roubles even seems a mere trifle. Before
taking leave of this devotee, I asked permission
to visit the library. “We have none,” he
replied. This poor fellow then seemed to me
really poor, and I was sorry I could not offer
him a gratuity of a kind I would have bestowed
with more pleasure. M. de Custine says the
monastery has a library, but that the regulations
do not permit the public to see it. I
only hope what M. de Custine says is true.</p>

<p>On returning from this visit, a young man
called Constantine Kokcharof came to see me.
His complexion was a yellowish brown, and he
had prominent cheekbones like the Mongols,
crisp hair and full lips like an African, a short
stature, and yet great muscular strength. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
seemed to hold a place between the native of
the North and that of the tropical forests. If
he would only have made researches into his
genealogy, I am sure he would have traced his
origin to the Mongols after the race had passed
through some change in India. He said to
me on entering: “May God, monsieur, bless
your journey!” Then he gave me his name
and held out his hand according to the
Siberian custom. In Russia it is thought to
be impolite not to offer the hand immediately
on making an acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” added Constantine, “I am the
friend of M. Sabachnikof, whom you have met
at the house of M. Pfaffius, the commissary of
Kiachta. I am returning to Irkutsk, where
my parents live. I had written to M. Pfaffius
to ask him if I might accompany him into
Siberia, and he replied by giving me your
address. Will you take me for your travelling
companion? I will serve you as interpreter,
and with me you will have the advantage of
travelling as fast or as easily as it suits you,
and, moreover, of taking the route that would
be most convenient to yourself.”</p>

<p>I showed him my letters of recommendation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
and among them he found one for his father
and another for his uncle, both being imperial
functionaries in Siberia. We settled the business
at once, and I then occupied myself solely
with preparations for departure.</p>

<p>My young companion was most valuable to
me, because he was thoroughly acquainted with
the route we were to take.</p>

<p>He was going to traverse, for the sixth time,
the immense space that intervenes between
Moscow and the Amoor river. He had made
the journey in summer and in winter; he was
therefore fully competent to advise me as to
what arrangements had to be made, and what
precautions it would be indispensable to take
against cold and fatigue. He informed me
that, in the sledge, besides my <i>jenotte</i> fur, I
should roll myself up in a <i>dacha</i>, a kind of
mantle, furred inside and out, in which the
wearer, being muffled from head to foot, disappeared
altogether. The one I bought the following
day was lined with white hare skin, and
covered again with elk skin, the hair of which
was short, but thick. These two fur dresses
not being considered sufficiently <i>à la mode</i>, I
was obliged to set off with collars of beaver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Swaddled in this manner, I innocently imagined
I could face with impunity the most
rigorous cold of Siberia.</p>

<p>I have met, in the course of my travels, many
a sharper and with many an impudent attempt
at extortion, but never with a demand supported
with such unscrupulous reasoning as
that of the interpreter at the hotel at Moscow.
“Monsieur,” he began unblushingly, “you owe
me at least a recompense of three hundred
francs. I will show you in what way. You had
urgent need of a Russian companion to go
through Siberia. When M. Kokcharof came to
ask for you, I could easily have told him that
I did not know you, and in keeping on talking
with him, have found out his address. Then
I might have come and said to you: ‘I have
just found the man you want, but I cannot
promise to let you know his name and where
he may be found unless you give me a thousand
francs.’ Now, monsieur, <i>you know, I
have not done such a thing as that</i>, and you ought,
indeed, to take it into consideration.”</p>

<p>My rage made me forget for the moment
the article in the decree of the Emperor&mdash;the
interdiction to strike a subject. I was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
raise my hand, but I raised my foot instead,
and, in this way, speedily dismissed the barefaced
impostor. I found out afterwards that
this man was a Pole, a circumstance that enabled
me to calm my conscience, for could the decree
be meant for these convicts? Having finally
secured my trunks, I went, in company with
M. Constantine Kokcharof, chatting with him
all the way, to take the train for Nijni-Novgorod.</p>

<p>Nijni-Novgorod is the last station of the
railway before entering by road into Siberia.</p>

<p>To get from the railway station to the city,
it is necessary to cross the Oka river, at about
a few hundred yards before it falls into the
Volga. When I arrived at Novgorod, on the
15th of December, the winter passage over the
ice had begun. The surface of the Oka was
furrowed with the passage of sledges coming
from Irkutsk, from Nicolaefsk, from the world’s
end, in fact, and bringing to the railway all
kinds of Asiatic provisions. Every river in
Russia and Siberia freezes in a different way.
Some even have an aspect so special as to
enable one, at a mere glance at the ice, to say
which river it is. This peculiarity is caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
by atmospheric conditions, by the nature and
form of the shores, and especially by the rate
of movement of the stream at the time of
congelation.</p>

<p>The Oka, when frozen, presents on its surface
a series of great protuberances, in form
something like a succession of mounds and
consequent dales. The untravelled foreigner
sees in his imagination the rivers of the North,
during winter, presenting a surface like plate
glass, whereon skaters make long excursions
at a rapid pace, and thus accomplish long
journeys. Except, perhaps, the Volga, over
which the ice, on account of the sluggishness
of the current, is almost everywhere level, but
where the presence of snow, however, does not
admit of skating, I have seen in Russia no
river whatever covered to any extent with a
smooth surface of ice; indeed, many of them
have a surface so uneven, that it would be
impossible for any vehicle to pass over them.</p>

<p>The course of the Oka, however, is not of
this character; its frozen surface is one of the
least rugged. As for me, hitherto inexperienced
in Northern locomotion, I should certainly
not have supposed, on looking over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
roughness of the route, that I was journeying
over a frozen river, if my attention had not
been attracted by a strange noise beneath, a
noise too strange to be forgotten, and sufficient
to dismiss from my mind any illusion
that I was travelling over an ordinary road.</p>

<p>It was a hollow rumbling sound in a deep
gulf below. To the excited fancy of the wayfarer,
it seemed, at times, the echoed roar of
some angry demon imprisoned in the depths
of an icy cave; and the traveller, listening as
he is whisked along, is affected by a terrifying
sensation of sinking, produced by the alternate
rising and falling of the sledge over the undulating
surface&mdash;a movement from which he involuntarily
recoils. Just as in a carriage, when
the horses are rushing on with uncontrolled
impetuosity, he instinctively throws himself
backwards, as if to struggle against the force
that would hurl him to destruction, or, standing
on the ridge of a precipice, he impulsively
recoils towards surer ground from the abyss
yawning to devour him, so, the first time he
travels over the frozen river, he shrinks from a
movement, but from one against which it is in
vain to struggle; for, in glancing over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
fragile partition, he finds he is contending, not
to attain solid ground, for there is no shore of
safety near for retreat, but hopelessly against
his own weight. He is irritated at the presence
of others there, at their not becoming as light
as air; he is angry with everybody and everything
that is heavy, because what aggravates
the danger by its weight, men or baggage, is
exasperating, and, indeed, not without reason,
for every ponderous atom, in his imagination,
exaggerates the imminence of that desperate
moment when, without the resource of a jutting
branch or anything stable presented providentially
to his grasp, this frail, frozen floor
should break under the weight like a pane of
glass, and plunge him into all the horrors of
a glacial sepulture.</p>

<p>Scared with this appalling phantom that
clung to me in my first sledging experience,
it was a great relief to regain the solid ground
with no roaring gulf beneath, and a still
greater pleasure to arrive safe at Novgorod.</p>

<p>The city of Nijni-Novgorod is picturesquely
constructed, and, at the same time, very interesting,
on account of the liveliness of its bazaars.</p>

<p>The Volga where it receives the waters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the Oka is, at least, four miles wide. A great
hill, or rather a mountain, swells up along the
right bank of this immense sheet of water,
and Novgorod rises proudly on the summit of
this mountain, watching on one side Asia
and on the other Europe, ready to awaken
the Russian empire to any danger that might
menace it from one quarter or the other. Communicating
freely with remote districts by aid
of its railway and two fine waterways, protected
against catastrophes of inundations by
its elevated position, against the misfortune of
poverty by its extensive commerce, and
against the calamity of decadence by its
important annual fair, Novgorod is one of
the most agreeable cities in Russia to visit,
because, contrary to what one generally meets
with in this vast empire, everything here has
an air of gaiety, of busy prosperity, and lively
movement.</p>

<p>The streets of the bazaars especially present
extraordinary animation. Even when it is not
the season of the great fair, they are picturesque
with the costumes, the most singular
and dissimilar, of every Asiatic race, specimens
of which the stranger encounters at every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
step. In this business quarter, the only one,
perhaps, so constructed in Russia, the houses
have several stories, and the shops rise one
above the other, although they do not always
belong to the same proprietor. Wooden
balconies, ascended by means of exterior
staircases, where one may circulate from one
end of the street to the other, serve the public
in going to make their purchases at the shops
of the upper stories.</p>

<p>In the other parts of the city, the houses are
elegant, and they are almost wholly built of
stone, houses, in fact, which, in any city
beyond Moscow, and still more beyond Kazan,
would be considered even magnificent.
Numerous comfortable hotels offer an asylum
to the traveller, who sees around him here,
as well as in the city, bustling though not
extensive, conspicuous results of the activity
of its inhabitants and the incessant movement
of commerce.</p>

<p>From the foot of the column dedicated to
Sviataslof Vsevolovitch, on the spot where he
vanquished the Swedes and Poles, that rises
on one of the highest summits of the great hill
on which Novgorod is built, the stranger may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
contemplate a prospect that might serve as
a type of a Russian landscape in winter. In
the plain below sleeps the Volga, silent and
still to the senses in its winter dress; for the
frost, one of nature’s forces, the most imposing
from its effects, has already congealed
the surface of its running stream into the
solidity and quiescence of the plain. One sees
on the left bank of this river, and to an
enormous distance through the crepuscular
gloom common to these latitudes in winter,
a series of long, vast undulations, covered with
boundless forests, leafless, dark and dreary.
Here and there, however, the melancholy
monotonous uniformity is broken by a few
patches of pines, but elsewhere the white
trunks of the birch start up like apparitions
in this desolate expanse of savage nature.</p>

<p>This scene, characteristic of Russia in
winter, is one of the most mournful and uninviting
to behold, and the stranger who has
once seen it wonders why any people, however
wretched, do not shudder at the idea of establishing
themselves in a land where nature is
so cheerless and inhospitable.</p>

<span class="subhead">FROM NIJNI-NOVGOROD TO KAZAN.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Volga in winter&mdash;Varieties of podarojnaia&mdash;What is
necessary for a long sledge journey&mdash;Departure from
Nijni&mdash;Posting relays&mdash;A momentary thaw&mdash;The snow&mdash;Arrival
at Kazan.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hardly had I arrived at Novgorod, when I
wished to begin my journey in a sledge as
soon as possible. Thus man is attracted
towards unknown adventures, even should he
feel he is doomed to become, in consequence of
them, a sufferer.</p>

<p>I went at once to the governor of the
province, in order that he might afford me
every facility for obtaining horses at the several
posting stages. To obtain relays, there are
three kinds of recommendations, which are
called in Russian <i>podarojnaia</i>.</p>

<p>The most valuable and important of the
three is the <i>podarojnaia de courrier</i>, which can
only be obtained for exceptional cases, for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
envoy extraordinary of the Emperor for
instance.</p>

<p>When a traveller arrives at a stage provided
with this order, the posting master is
obliged to furnish horses immediately, and if
they are not there, to demand them elsewhere
by requisition; he also commands the driver
to gallop without intermission.</p>

<p>The Crown podarojnaia, although an order
of the second rank, is, nevertheless, much
appreciated. It is generally accorded to the
functionaries who are returning to their posts,
or to those who are travelling in the public
service. It was with one of these orders that
the governor of Nijni-Novgorod was pleased
to furnish me. The posting masters should
always reserve a <i>troïka</i> or <i>droïka</i> (a vehicle
with three horses) in case a traveller should
present himself furnished with a Crown podarojnaia.
It is therefore a rare occurrence to
the bearer of this important order when he
presents himself at a posting stage not to be
provided with horses immediately. The
drivers, under this order, have copper badges
attached to their caps and arms which warn
afar off other conductors coming in a contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
direction to clear the way immediately, under
a penalty of severe chastisement in case of
neglect; they also drive almost always at a
gallop, like the drivers of the podarojnaia de
courrier.</p>

<p>Between the Crown podarojnaia and the
simple podarojnaia, there is a great difference.
This is for the mass of ordinary travellers.
It is necessary to pay at once, pretty dearly, to
get it at all, and then the traveller is quite at
the mercy of the postmasters, who will not
give him horses unless they are disposed to
do so.</p>

<p>The rule is that each relay should have six
hours’ rest between each course. It, therefore,
often happens that the traveller finds at
the stages no other relays than those taking
their usual rest, excepting always the reserve
for the Crown podarojnaia. I have frequently
seen travellers who had been waiting, two or
three days, until the posting master was disposed
to accommodate them or had been tired
out with having his guests on his hands.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the contractors of relays find
every advantage in prolonging such a delay.
The guest does not pay for his lodging, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
is gratuitous, but he always takes there some
provisions, and the postmasters hope to
receive in the end, when he is tired out with
waiting, a liberal gratuity in addition, in order
to furnish a troïka, even with horses fatigued
from a recent course.</p>

<p>The organization of the posting between
Nijni-Novgorod and Tumen does not at present
belong to the Government. It is conceded
temporarily to M. Michaelof, who is making
a rapid fortune by letting his horses at a high
rate.</p>

<p>Provided, as I have mentioned, with a recommendation
from this fortunate contractor, and
also with a Crown podarojnaia, for which I
was indebted to the governor of Nijni, I thought
I should be able to start the following morning.</p>

<p>But, alas! I had reckoned, this time again,
without Siberian frosts.</p>

<p>To complete my preparations for a prolonged
journey in a sledge, I was obliged the
whole morning to run about from shop to shop.
The number of objects to be bought was incalculable.
Constantine had made out a list as
long as an apothecary’s bill. I did not get back
to my hotel till one in the afternoon, worn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
with fatigue, in a very bad humour, thirsty and
dying with hunger, and, moreover, so knocked
up, that I wished for nothing more than to go
to bed at once and rest my weary limbs.</p>

<p>I was in this state, when Constantine said to
me with all the coolness in the world: “Now,
monsieur, we are quite ready; do you wish
to start?” I was about to propose not to
get into the sledge till the following day, or
to wait at least a few hours, when I happened
to cast my eyes over my acquisitions, standing
in a great heap in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The heap that had bewildered me, when I
paid my visit to M. Pfaffius, was a mere hillock
beside this mountain. There were here heaped
up soft leather trunks filled with clothing, to
be put at the bottom of the sledge to deaden
the jerks, round valises, to serve as bolsters
at night, <i>touloupes</i>, a <i>dacha</i> in sheepskin,
cushions, mattresses, veal and mutton sausages,
felt boots, felt rugs, bottles of brandy, ropes,
a hammer, a liberal supply of tools for iron
and wood work, eight pairs of large worsted
stockings, belts, bags, a store of white bread,
pillows, and I don’t know what else. And
then, my trunks being no longer of any use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
all the clothing I had brought from France
lay distributed everywhere in this little room,
and for the first time found themselves in such
strange company. Neither the most crammed
railway cloak rooms, nor <i>chinoiserie</i> shops, nor
back rooms of pawnshops, nothing, in fact,
except perhaps the brain cases of certain
inveterate political reformers or the witches’
caldron in <i>Macbeth</i>, could give any idea of
such a perplexing jumble.</p>

<p>This exhilarating spectacle at once restored
my courage; I then had but one object in view&mdash;to
get out of it as speedily as possible and
start. I ordered horses on the instant.</p>

<div id="ip_56" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i085.jpg" width="600" height="399" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“THE SLEDGE BEING AN OPEN ONE, WE COULD ENJOY A VIEW OF THE COUNTRY.”</div></div>

<p>While a servant had gone in search of the
team, we, Constantine and myself, set to work
to pack all the articles I have just enumerated
into a sledge, which I had ordered from the
manufactory of Romanof&mdash;the most celebrated
of Russian coachbuilders. This sledge, especially,
was wonderfully built. Lightness and
strength, the two most important qualities of
a good vehicle, were united in it to the highest
point of excellence. The sledge being an
open one, at least in front, we could enjoy,
during the daytime, a view of the country;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
whilst a fixed hood, which we closed in completely
at night with tarred canvas, protected
us pretty well against the wind and the snow.
Two pieces of wood, fixed at a little height
above the ground and disposed in a sloping
position from the front to the back, prevented
the sledge from overturning, at least in ordinary
circumstances, and protected the body of
the vehicle against obstacles and shocks&mdash;encounters
that were met with, I believe, verily
twenty or thirty times a day.</p>

<p>Just as you make your bed, you lie on it,
says the proverb. And in Russia, just as one
arranges his sledge, he bears up in proportion
against the fatigue of the journey. Constantine
had, in this art, real talent. He laid
the mattresses in a slanting position, just
nicely calculated; he adroitly smoothed over,
in some way, every jutting angle or boss as
often as one or the other arose from the
settling of the contents during a long journey.
As soon as a cavity had formed from the
jolting, no matter where, he immediately filled
up the vacant space with hay, and everything
kept its place to the advantage of our ease.
He transformed, in short, our sledge into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
comfortable soft bed, which would have enabled
us to support, without fatigue, the fifteen
hundred leagues we had to traverse as far as
Irkutsk, if circumstances, which I shall subsequently
relate, had not occurred. When all
these preparations had been made and the
horses put to, I began to wrap myself in my
travelling costume.</p>

<p>Those who have not visited Siberia have
no idea of the excessive wrapping-up and
muffling necessary to a traveller on a long
journey in that climate.</p>

<p>To put on such a great number of garments
is no light matter, and cannot be accomplished,
the first time especially, without laughing
outright a great deal and perspiring much
more.</p>

<p>We first put on four pairs of worsted stockings
and over them, like jack boots, a pair of
felt stockings that covered our legs. We then
wrapped ourselves in three garments of fur,
one over the other. Then we covered our
heads with an <i>astrakan</i> and a <i>bachelique</i>.
When we had got into the sledge we wrapped
our legs in a fur rug and then buried
ourselves side by side in two more fur rugs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
These accoutrements, which would be excessive
to protect one’s self merely for a few hours
against the cold, even the most intense, become
light enough and barely sufficient when
the traveller remains exposed to the air a long
time, and especially to the fatigue of a sledge
journey prolonged night and day, without
stopping to sleep.</p>

<p>The only defect in the construction of
Siberian sledges is the want of a seat for the
<i>yemschik</i> or driver: this unhappy individual
is obliged to sit on a wooden platform, that
covers the travellers’ legs, with his legs hanging
either on the right or left side, and, consequently,
has to drive from either side. When he
has troublesome horses to manage he gets on
his knees, or even stands up on the platform.
This arrangement is all the more inconvenient,
inasmuch as it requires unusual dexterity to
drive and hold in the mettlesome little horses
of Northern Asia. The moment they feel the
harness on their backs, whether from natural
ardour alone or from a want to get warm,
there is no holding them; their impatience
is unparalleled in horseflesh. They tremble
with excitement, they paw and scrape the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
ground, nibble at the snow, or make a huge
ball with it, and then scatter it in a cloud of
fine particles. The drivers have a very
difficult task to calm their impetuosity; they
accomplish this in the most soothing manner,
by means of a steady trill on their lips; they
sustain this more intensely the moment they
leap on the platform of the sledge, which
is for them a very delicate gymnastic feat,
demanding great agility. At this critical
moment, the horses, feeling no further restraint,
uncurbed, rampant, start off in a mad gallop, <i>le
diable en queue</i>. If, on the other hand, the driver
should lucklessly make an abortive attempt, he
is hurled over the crosspieces like a tile by the
passing gale, and the travellers go on without
a whip, flying on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>This was just the hairbreadth escape
that happened to the first yemschik chance
had thrown in our way. His horses, just as
he seized the platform to leap on to it,
started off at a furious pace. Like a brave
fellow, he kept his grip on it like a bulldog,
and, luckily, on the reins too, and was thus
hauled over the snow at our side for some
minutes. At the end of this critical interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
he found some lucky projection beside the
sledge, where he could support his knee, and
at last, thanks to the herculean strength of
his arms and the help we gave him, he
succeeded in gaining his seat and then tenaciously
clung to it to the end of the stage.
Thus equipped, we left Nijni-Novgorod on
the 17th of December at three o’clock in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>This first day’s journey in a sledge was
delightful and exhilarating. We felt all the
pleasure of the novelty of the locomotion
without yet beginning to experience the least
fatigue, and at every moment we met other
travellers coming, twenty and even thirty
leagues, to the city we had just quitted, on
their business or pleasure.</p>

<p>However great the distance may be, it is
never an obstacle to the Russians: they seem
to make nothing of it, and never to calculate
it. A lady at St. Petersburg said to me one
day: “You should go and see the cascade of
Tchernaiarietchka: I went there the other
day, and I was charmed with it; I never
dreamt there was anything so beautiful at our
city gates.” On making inquiries about it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
few days later, and as to how I could get
there, I found that it would take forty-eight
hours by rail, and twelve by diligence. I daresay
they will think of sending the poor seamen
who are ordered to join their ships at Nicolaefsk
to St. Petersburg gates; it is only three
hundred leagues from the Russian capital.
The reader will learn subsequently, if he is
interested in continuing the journey with me,
that the Siberians, of the fair sex even, are not
at all dismayed at the prospect of undertaking
journeys of fifteen hundred, nay, two thousand
leagues in a sledge, with young children to
boot, and these sometimes at the breast.</p>

<p>On account of the great novelty and variety
of the spectacle, I found the trip delightful on
leaving Novgorod. The time passed more
rapidly than the banks of the river, over whose
congealed surface our horses continued fleeing
at a mad pace as if pursued by a phantom.</p>

<p>This imposing Volga is of a character truly
quite exceptional. France, certainly, has no
river worthy of so much admiration for its
grandeur. During the summer it is enlivened
with an incessant movement of
steamers, and is of immense importance as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
waterway; and during winter also it continues
rendering great services to humanity, affording
the means for the transport of the grain that it
has fertilized with its beneficent waters.
Nothing is grander than this glacial route of
unusual width, and of a uniformity and smoothness
which no road laid by the hand of man
can approach; without a pebble or a rut, one
glides over without a jolt. Nothing interests
the traveller more, the first time, than to watch
the shores passing before the eye like a
panorama; to contemplate the mountains and
valleys the frozen way spares him the trouble
of traversing; to coast the islands without
navigating; and to pass here and there some
barque, or perhaps steamer, imprisoned in the
ice.</p>

<p>In about three hours and a half after leaving
Novgorod, we reached our first stage, it being
then quite dark.</p>

<p>In all these posting stages, there is a room
for the travellers; and this room, though
heated at the proprietor’s expense, becomes
really a free home for the wanderer: he may
eat, drink, and sleep there; do, in fact, whatever
he likes; and what is still more singular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
lodge there as long as he wishes, no one
having a right to dislodge him.</p>

<p>Although this privilege is secured by
contracts made between the posting masters
and the Imperial administration, it would
undoubtedly be quite consistent with the
Russian character to accord it if it were not
compulsory, the people being essentially hospitable.</p>

<p>This amiable quality results, perhaps, from
the rigour of the climate; but I am rather
disposed to believe&mdash;so general and spontaneous
is it&mdash;that it is the consequence of a
happy and generous disposition.</p>

<p>I shall have something more to say, by-and-by,
on the merits of the Russian peasantry.
I do not say that they have a monopoly of this
benevolent spirit, for, indeed, it is common to
all classes. The society of St. Petersburg
cannot, certainly, be suspected to be wanting
in kindness towards strangers; even the old
Muscovite noble, notwithstanding his haughtiness,
notwithstanding his hatred of new social
institutions, notwithstanding his regret to see
Moscow no longer the residence of the
emperors, and, moreover, his antipathy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
European ideas and fashions, adopted in the
new capital;&mdash;in spite of all that, the Muscovite
lord has retained profoundly rooted in his
nature the old traditions of respect towards
him who is his guest, and he regards hospitality,
not simply as a passive virtue, but
seriously as an active duty.</p>

<p>At the Siberian posting stages, the stranger
often finds pleasant company or something to
amuse him in the travellers’ room; it is rare to
find it unoccupied; and when people are disposed
to talk, subjects of conversation are not
wanting. Those who are going in a contrary
direction begin inquiring about everything
that interests them on the way; about the
state of the route; about the difficulties, more
or less serious, that have been encountered in
getting horses. Those who are taking the
same way have generally already met at one
or more stages, and now salute one another
as old acquaintances. When the stage
happens to be in a village, the principal
persons of the neighbourhood generally come
to pass away an hour or two very sociably
with the travellers. They are very curious to
know all about political matters from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
who come from the West, and business affairs
from those coming from the East. They all
chat together in a manner perfectly free and
easy, without the least exclusiveness on account
of class, profession, or position. Their intercourse
is always marked with the utmost good-nature
and affability.</p>

<p>But at the stages that link Nijni to Kazan
this kind of society is not always so agreeable.</p>

<p>The travellers around here are, in fact, a
little too much <i>civilized</i> to be always quite
so simple and warm-hearted. They are,
perhaps, a little too well initiated in the new
social principles of <i>égalité</i> and <i>fraternité</i> to
believe that these amiable sentiments have so
profoundly modified human nature as they find
it in their surroundings. They look on the
people accident throws in their way rather
as competitors for accommodation, whose
presence there may contribute to retard their
journey, and would, if they had the <i>liberté</i>,
such as their brethren and equals understand
it (from the purely practical side of the
formula), much rather smash their brethren’s
sledges, than give them a helping hand under
difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
I did not linger very long in these first
stages, where, on account of the privileged
recommendations I was favoured with for
obtaining horses, I met only with unfriendly
looks and gestures; therefore, in twelve hours
from my departure, I had already accomplished
more than a quarter of the distance that
separated me from Kazan.</p>

<p>We continued travelling over the Volga. A
little before daybreak I was surprised at the
strange noise that was being produced by the
horses’ feet over the ice: it was no longer the
dull, hollow sound that had terrified me at
Nijni-Novgorod. It was to me one quite novel,
and people generally, especially the most
experienced,&mdash;a circumstance far from reassuring,&mdash;begin
to get uneasy at it. This sound
seemed to me the most fearful that one could
hear on the ice; it was a splashing. I listened
in terror; but as my companion had smiled at
my first affright at Nijni, I did not venture, till
after a long interval, to reveal it to him this
time.</p>

<p>Through an excess of <i>amour-propre</i> which I
probably now derived from intercourse with
Russians, I was just going to allow him to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
off asleep, when I was splashed full in the face,
and my terror, excited to its highest pitch,
could no longer be smothered. I started up,
leaping almost over Constantine, who, to use
a Siberian saying, “was snoring enough to
frighten the wolves.” It was but a poor resource
against actual danger. Whilst I was rousing
him, my wits seemed to be going a-wool-gathering;
what wonderful feat were they not going
to perform in such a peril as this? My imagination
in fact, stirred up, no doubt, by the poesy
of the journey, brought to my mind Dame
Fortune saving the life of a sleeping infant
on the brink of a well. The complete absence
of wheels, however, soon brought me round to
sober reality, and I explained the situation
to Constantine with a conciseness that might
serve as a model to many an orator. He
questioned the yemschik on the matter, who
replied with complete indifference: “Yes, sir,
it is thawing; but it is merely the snow melting:
the ice is just as thick as ever.”</p>

<p>The sky being very cloudy, the night was
profoundly dark. Experience principally
served to guide the driver in his course, and
then the water&mdash;a fatal indication, indeed, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the way, when this way is over the bed of a
frozen river! I crept back, without saying a
word more, into the bottom of the sledge; but
I must admit that it seemed to me that the
ice successively yielded, cracked, and opened,
and then, freezing over again with sufficient
thickness, bore us up firmly. What does not
the imagination shadow forth to an excited
brain?</p>

<p>Gradually, but very gradually, the day came
forth, or it would be more exact to say rather
a kind of twilight, for a thick fog veiled
nearly every object from our eyes. The summits
of the hills that continuously command
the right bank of the Volga marked a shadow
on the horizon barely more sombre. Everything
else appeared confounded in a general
grey hue, and nothing, not even the shore, could
be distinguished. Our ears soon began to
catch the ominous sounds of a crackling under
the horses’ feet, thereby announcing that the
thaw had begun its work, now, indeed, on the
ice. Then we could just distinguish very
portentous fissures, starting right and left
under the passage of the sledge. The yemschik
at last, discovering that the situation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
becoming perilous, thought it now high time
to take precautions. He therefore dashed on
as if chased by a pack of famishing wolves as
far as the first village, and here we were glad
to set foot at last on <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>The following night snow began to fall, to
our great discomfiture; for no state of the
atmosphere here is so disagreeable to travellers
in a sledge only partially closed.</p>

<p>Fatigued by the exciting emotions of the
preceding night, and especially by thirty-six
hours’ duration of a kind of locomotion to
which I was not yet accustomed, I had fallen
into a sound sleep. As it was not very cold,
Constantine and I had never thought of lowering
the canvas that partially closes in the front
of the vehicle, and, moreover, we had neglected
to take the precaution to cover our faces. But
as the warmth of our breath dissolved the
flakes that would otherwise have interrupted
our respiration, we had scarcely noticed our
situation. The snow, indeed, had penetrated
and fallen thickly everywhere; our faces even
were quite covered; it had insinuated itself in
the openings of our <i>dachas</i>, and melting there,
saturated our inner mantles: water was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
running fast down our necks and sleeves; we
were drenched: and it was likely to have been
a very serious matter if the cold, which then
commenced to make itself felt very acutely,
had not roused us from our slumbers. But
what a transition was that awakening! My
mind, which seemed at first to be wandering
far away from actual life, could in no way
account for the situation; we opened our eyes,
it is true, but were unable to distinguish anything;
we felt a load pressing us down everywhere,
and yet we were unable to grasp anything.
I fancied myself one moment in a delirium and
in the next the victim of a vivid nightmare;
but the cold at last brought me to my senses.
The first thing we did was to urge the
yemschik to drive as fast as he could, that we
might dry ourselves as soon as possible at the
first stage. The wind now turned towards the
north, the clouds had dispersed, and a piercing
cold benumbed our limbs. Everything was
frozen to our garments, which had become
to the touch as rigid as tanned hides bristling
“like quills upon the fretful porcupine.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, in this plight, the distance that
separated us from Kazan was not very great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
The surface of the Volga, on which we were
enabled to continue our journey at daybreak,
contributed very much to shorten the way, and
on the 19th of December, about one in the
afternoon, we drove into the ancient capital of
the Tartars, after having accomplished what
they consider in Siberia a short, easy journey.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Virgin of Kazan&mdash;Russian manner of expressing disapproval&mdash;Dining
with a grandee&mdash;His description of the
enfranchisement of the serfs&mdash;The Tartars&mdash;Journey in
a sledge&mdash;Caravan of exiles&mdash;The Votiaks&mdash;Aspect of
European Russia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The city of Kazan is not situated on the
banks of the Volga. It stands at the distance
of at least half a mile from the left bank of
this river.</p>

<p>The day after we arrived here, Constantine
introduced me to one of his old college companions,
a young man who had just finished
his studies in medicine at the university of
Kazan. Being desirous of seeing Kazan and
its neighbourhood, and this young medical
man knowing them well, I begged him to
become my guide, which he most courteously
consented to do.</p>

<p>We first went to the university, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
celebrated; then to the cathedral, which interested
me very much. Its style is different
from the Byzantine&mdash;a style that obtrudes so
often on the eye of the stranger in Russia
that he at last gets tired of it; but this
cathedral reminds one of certain portions of
the ancient Kremlin, and is evidently a construction
of a remote period. Its paintings
are very crude, as in the early stages of the
art, though well-executed specimens of the
epoch. Another object that attracted my
attention was the high altar in massive silver.</p>

<p>Then we went on a pilgrimage to the Virgin
of Kazan, the patron saint of travellers. This
virgin was formerly left hanging on a tree in
the middle of the forest. There she performed
wonderful miracles amid the awestruck peasantry,
who made long pilgrimages to obtain
pardon of their sins and find favour in her
sight. One of the chief bishops of Kazan,
touched at her exposure in so wild a spot,
ordered her to be conducted to the cathedral,
that she might be honoured in a sanctuary
worthy of her merits. But on the day following
the ceremony the lady excited the greatest
wonder and admiration by returning herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
to her accustomed place in the forest. It was
in vain they led her back three times in a
grand procession to the city; for the repeated
miracle of her return just as often clearly
indicated her will and pleasure. Since the
lady would not go to a church, a church was
obliged to come to the lady, and one accordingly
came, or rather rose, on this privileged
spot, and then followed in its wake a monastery
which became, after that of Troïtsa, one of
the richest in Russia. Then later habitations
of the devoted began to cluster around, and
now the Virgin of Kazan, whether she likes it
or not, is shut up in a city.</p>

<p>This wonderful virgin, the reader will understand,
is a little picture, pretty well executed
in the Byzantine style and of great antiquity.</p>

<p>As I wished to see this treasure, we went
there and sent to the abbess to obtain permission
to visit it; but, to my disappointment and
vexation, it was refused. This was the only
occasion on which doors were closed against
me whenever I presented myself, either in
European Russia or Siberia, to gratify my
curiosity in visiting any public building.</p>

<p>The young student who accompanied me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
was disgusted at the scrupulosity or ill-nature
of the abbess, and manifested his feelings
in a way more significant than delicate&mdash;a way
quite common with Russians&mdash;by spitting with
great energy repeatedly on the ground. But
in spite of this unseemly reception of the
abbess’s message, he was most respectful and
courteous towards the nun who bore it, and we
went away exchanging bows, as if she had
conferred on us the highest favour.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE MOTHER-SUPERIOR OF KAZAN MONASTERY.</div></div>

<p>This dainty habit of expressing disapproval
or protestation by salivary effusion is so
common and popular that it finds its way even
into literature. It was here, just in this city,
that I was present at a play wherein the
author tried to represent as effectively as
possible how far domestic quarrels might go
in a household composed of members who
were not very accommodating to one another.
The representation was perfectly intelligible
to me from beginning to end, notwithstanding
my ignorance of the Russian language, simply
because the best arguments employed by the
leading characters in the play consisted principally
in repetitions of this gesture, certainly
far more expressive than delicate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
And so far as regarded my young companion
also, if anything would have withheld
him from responding quite as demonstratively
to the abbess herself on receiving her refusal,
it would not have been any sentiment of
reverence or scruples of piety, and for a very
good reason: because the students of the
university of Kazan pique themselves on being
freethinkers.</p>

<p>But what is much more serious in the
Russian territory is that they strain the theory
of emancipation to embrace ideas of political
liberty in its most liberal sense. The Government,
however, knows how to suppress this
excess of enthusiasm as soon as it manifests
itself. At the time of the Polish insurrection,
three students having a little too openly
demonstrated their views, one was shot and
the other two banished for life to the Siberian
deserts.</p>

<p>The liberation of the serfs had naturally
caused a great deal of bitter feeling towards
the late Czar on the part of certain aristocratic
landowners; and the Russian liberals
have succeeded, in a great measure, in
conciliating the latter by sympathizing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
them in their imaginary wrong; thus it
sometimes happens that nobles and liberals
share the same hopes, and consequently draw
closer to one another. With this spirit
pervading these two classes, the reader will
not be surprised to learn that I was introduced
by a student of the university of Kazan to
an important personage of the old Russian
aristocracy.</p>

<p>He entertained me with an account of the
enfranchisement of the serfs, and it was
naturally from his own point of view; but
since these views differ very widely among
people with whom I have conversed on the
subject, according to their interests or prejudices,
I will give in his own words the
opinion of this old Russian noble without
making any comment on it. He thus began:</p>

<p>“Formerly all the Russian territory belonged
to the nobles. The peasant, of course,
was at the mercy of the lord on whose land
he lived, and was obliged to give him a
certain amount of work. The lord, however,
never abused this privilege; on the contrary,
he was in the habit of distributing every year
among the peasantry a certain quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
land to farm for their own benefit, as a recompense
for their services. Under this
arrangement, the peasant had an interest in
working; he worked for his master, and the
land consequently improved, and then he
worked for himself, to obtain some comfort in
his old age. The land under this system
produced more, and the general prosperity
could not fail to increase accordingly.</p>

<p>“But then the Czar, just like Louis XIV.
in France, fearing the growing influence of
the aristocracy, gave to the peasantry the
lands they had hitherto merely farmed. The
Emperor himself undertook to indemnify the
lords, reserving to himself the right of receiving,
in the form of a land tax, the established
rents, which, in the absence of such a liberality,&mdash;a
liberality more apparent than real&mdash;the
peasant would have continued paying to his
lord. Since that time, the lords, deprived of
their authority, have almost all abandoned
their lands; the peasantry discover that the
profits of their lands are absorbed by the
Imperial tax; and this tax, itself inequitably
assessed, does not, without much difficulty,
find its way into the coffers of the state. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
consequence of this enfranchisement, accorded
solely with the object of increasing the Czar’s
authority, is an injury in the first place to
the serfs, then to the nobility, and finally to
the state.”</p>

<p>This noble, as it appears, would admit no
advantage whatever. The most insignificant
social changes, however just&mdash;and there are
none now in Russia that are not&mdash;appeared
to him in the light of iniquities.</p>

<p>In the presence of these retrograde views,
the political creed of the most ardent French
Legitimists would appear revolutionary.</p>

<p>I was very much entertained, nevertheless,
the evening I passed with him, where the old
Russian manners and habits were scrupulously
observed. When we rose from the supper
table each of the guests went up to the host
and hostess to shake hands in token of
gratitude, to which they replied in the prescribed
form: “I beg you will excuse me
for what God has this day given me to eat,
when I have the honour to receive you.” And
to this they added such compliments as: “À
votre santé”; “Les absents n’ont pas toujours
tort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
These complimentary customs, however
amiable they may seem externally, lose a
great deal of their sincerity when the motive
that gives rise to them becomes apparent;
and this undoubtedly is vanity, and especially
the vain desire of exhibiting a little magnificence
and expense. The real meaning of
these fine phrases is: “I pray you to take
notice that I have just offered myself a bottle
of champagne, and the satisfaction it gives me
in making you a witness of this luxurious
habit surpasses any other pleasure I could
possibly get out of it.”</p>

<p>The Tartar population that enlivens the
streets of Kazan contributes very much to
the picturesqueness of the city. Notwithstanding
that they have been deprived of their
territory ever since 1552, the Tartars can,
with a very good grace, hold up their heads
wherever they show themselves in Kazan, for
they are not only the founders of the city,
but they defended it with great bravery
against their enemies, who captured it only
after severe losses. After having made several
bold sorties and repelled many desperate
assaults, they courageously bore their sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
from the want of water&mdash;a calamity the
Russians inflicted on them by cutting off their
communications with the Volga. When the
last hope of victory died away the Tartar
queen flung herself headlong from the top of
the Sonnbec tower&mdash;a building which remains
well preserved to the present day.</p>

<p>This interesting tower, from its combination
of the minaret and the pagoda, reminds one
of the people whose features are half Arab
and half Mongol. It stands on a commanding
eminence over the city, and forms certainly
one of its most beautiful and attractive objects.</p>

<p>The Tartar harems are much less accessible
than those of the Bosphorus or of Tunis,
perhaps because Mahomedan fanaticism, in
being here roused through impatience of
Christian domination, has become all the more
uncompromising. I therefore found it impossible
to catch a glimpse of a single
individual of these jealously guarded communities;
and I was rather disappointed,
because in judging from their lords, I had
formed an idea that they must be very beautiful.
The regularity and symmetry of features of
the Arab race are associated in the Tartars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
with great muscular strength, and the dignified
and haughty glance of a race impatient of
conquest. This highly favoured physique is
accompanied with moral attributes as elevated,
and the Russians, however disdainfully they
treat this people, have nevertheless adopted
the proverb: “Honest and faithful as a
Tartar.”</p>

<p>Kazan is the last European city on the road
to Siberia that still preserves a European
aspect, in so far as many of its houses are built
of stone, and are ranged in streets of definite
form. I was, therefore, getting impatient to
quit it, and to see something of an Asiatic
character.</p>

<p>Constantine and I went together to purchase
a supply of eatables for our journey. We laid
in a supply of sausages, some caviare, cheese,
not forgetting white bread, which, when soaked
in tea, is the principal part of the subsistence on
a journey in Siberia. To venture on a journey
in these parts, one should be neither a <i>gourmet</i>
nor a <i>gourmand</i>. I have often been astonished
to find how very little is necessary to sustain
the human body, and wonder why we Frenchmen
at home take so much trouble to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
our stomachs so little rest and so much unnecessary
work.</p>

<p>We went through the operation, for the
second time, of getting into our three heavy
fur garments, and on the 22nd of December,
at four in the afternoon, we were gliding along
again cosily, side by side, over the frozen
snowy dust of the road leading to Siberia.</p>

<p>In order to go at a brisk rate in a sledge,
it is necessary that the snow over which it is
moving be well beaten down. Private sledges
are not numerous enough to prepare a way by
crushing the snow, so this work is done by
sledges carrying goods; and since these follow
in a line in the wake of one another, the
beaten part of the road, on which one is
desirous of gliding, is of very limited width.
The consequence of this narrowness of the
chosen way is that two sledges never pass
without clashing against each other; nor are
the yemschiks very solicitous about avoiding a
collision, since they know perfectly well their
own necks are quite safe, the long projecting
wooden guards, which I have already described,
being amply sufficient to protect them
from danger. The sledges thus guarded whisk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
rapidly along one against the other, sometimes
striking one another with a shock in which
horses and sledge are thrown down and shot
off at a tangent across the road.</p>

<p>The worst kind of these collisions is the
shock from two sledges of unequal size: the
larger of the two, being generally too heavy to
be simply hurled aside by its adversary, as is
the case with the lighter vehicle, is taken
underneath and lifted instead, and occasionally
high enough to be almost overturned.</p>

<p>But it is never a complete overthrow: the
sledge thus thrown off or lifted slides along on
a single skate and on the end of the long
wooden guard, and they do not stop for so
trifling a matter. The yemschik, unable to
keep himself on an inclined plane without
holding, hangs on to the apron and maintains
his place by the sheer strength of his arms;
the horses still go on at a gallop, and the
travellers proceed three or even five hundred
yards in this half-tilted posture till some rut in
the road brings the sledge down again on
both skates.</p>

<p>Each part of the road to Siberia has its
special advantages and disadvantages, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
incidents just mentioned are of common occurrence
when the wanderer no longer travels over
a frozen river. The most disagreeable effect
of this constant jolting, to an inexperienced
traveller, is the want of sleep. During the
whole night after we left Kazan I never closed
my eyes a moment, whilst Constantine gave
evident proofs of the soundness of his slumber
by a prolonged sonorous snoring, equally uninterrupted
whether he fell on me or I fell on
him, crushing him even with all my weight.</p>

<p>I was bemoaning sadly within myself a long,
tedious night, passed without sleep, when we
came up at daybreak with a caravan of exiles.
These poor wretches, dragging their chains
afoot, were wearily trudging along, with a long
journey before them, to the far end of Eastern
Siberia. I had not at that time more pity for
assassins and thieves than I have now, and
since the day I passed the Russian frontier,
conspirators have appeared to me no better,
perhaps even worse; still it touched me to the
heart to see these unhappy creatures, with a
wearisome journey of three thousand leagues
before them, and their fate too&mdash;if they lived
to reach the end of the dreary march&mdash;instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of there finding a home to cheer them, to find
nothing but a gaol!</p>

<p>A few sledges were following this caravan,
and when I inquired why they thus accompanied
it, I was briefly informed: “For the
invalids and princes.” A phrase that had on
reflection a great deal of meaning in it, and
suggested very forcibly the formidable power
of the Emperor in Russia, a sovereign power
before which every subject, from the humblest
serf to the highest prince of the realm, must
bow down, with their differences almost lost
in the equal degree of subjection.</p>

<p>The Emperor, in fact, may without trial
condemn any subject to two years’ imprisonment,
and even, if he thinks proper to do so,
banish him for life.</p>

<p>It occurred to me, as I was watching these
poor exiles, that there might be one innocent,
and this thought would have made me very
uneasy if I had not by this time become too
good a Russian subject to venture to entertain
it very long.</p>

<p>It is not at all an uncommon occurrence in
Siberia to meet travellers afoot. I have seen,
it is true, but very few women that recalled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
my memory “the Siberian girl” of Xavier de
Maistre; if I had, and our road had been in
the same direction, I should have offered them
perhaps a place in my sledge, just as the
peasants of the Ural mountains compassionately
helped the heroine, where she became
so popular, to reach the end of her painful
journey. But I have met men, very often in
all kinds of weather and situations, trudging
on foot, in spite of the snow and the intense
cold, across a dreary extent of country where
no human habitation could be seen, in order to
reach some remote region with the hope of
providing for a domestic want, to accomplish
a pilgrimage, or to proceed to some
destination under the coercion of the Government.</p>

<p>Amongst these was a young soldier on leave
at home with his parents, and who had been
ordered suddenly to join his regiment in
garrison at Kazan. He was then in ill-health,
but notwithstanding his feeble condition, he set
off at once, and it might be said even with
pleasure, because the will of the Emperor was
in question. He was compelled to do so, they
would tell me; no doubt he was: but the sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of obedience and loyalty is so deeply
implanted in the Russian peasant, that he will
submit to suffering without a murmur the
half of which he would not undergo for any
other personage than his sovereign.</p>

<p>When he had nearly come to his journey’s
end, this brave young fellow, being no longer
able to drag one foot after the other, and
seized with giddiness and fainting, had
wandered a few yards from the track beaten
by the sledges, and there lay almost buried in
the snow, the even surface of which had deceptively
hidden a sudden fall in the ground.
Just as I was passing by, a man of strange
aspect had saved him from a terrible fate and
was watching over him: this good Samaritan
had a red beard and red hair under a thick
shaggy fur cap; over his shoulder were slung a
long bow and some arrows, and his feet were
strapped on two long narrow planks of sufficient
length to keep him whilst thus gliding
over the snow from sinking into it, even at
the spot where the young soldier was lying
almost lost to sight in its ominous embrace.</p>

<p>As I had now gathered much information
regarding the indigenous races, I recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
him almost at a glance to be a Votiak. With
the aid of this good man, we helped the poor
soldier on to a goods sledge, one of a file that
fortunately happened to be passing at the
moment, as if almost by a miracle. Having
done this, we gave him some brandy to warm
him, a little food, and then, being assured of
his safety, we parted, each on our way.</p>

<div id="ip_90" class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;"><img src="images/i123.jpg" width="394" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A VOTIAK WITH SNOW-SHOES.</div></div>

<p>I was much interested in examining this
specimen of a race that has occupied the
country, not only before the Russians, but
before the Tartars. The Votiaks seem to have
preserved all their ancient freedom, and they
roam the intricate and boundless forests of
Eastern Russia in pursuit of game, on which
they subsist. I regretted almost the direction
I had to take as I watched this Votiak disappearing
gradually amid the trees like a spirit
of the forest, careless of the rifts over which he
passed without seeming to notice them, a
mythological union of half beast and half man:
externally, in colour and roughness of ways, a
beast; and internally, in humanity and tender-heartedness,
a man, as this act I have related
proved him to be&mdash;a curious combination of
savageness and sensibility. I would willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
have followed this man and have had the
liberty to hunt, in his company, the deer, the
wolf, and the bear, to study his simple manners
and lead his strange life; but when I could not
make without fatigue a simple excursion in a
sledge, I felt on comparison humiliated at the
thought of having so little power of endurance.</p>

<p>In 1774 the Votiaks were fifty-five thousand
in number, and since this period no census has
been taken. Many have been converted to
Christianity, though a large number remain
idolaters, and still practise the superstitious
ceremonies of their worship in the depths of
their forests.</p>

<p>Tents pitched at certain distances from each
other, generally in some picturesque spot,
covered with groups of pine and birch, serve
them as a sanctuary; these tents have but one
opening, and that always facing the south.
They are entirely void of furniture or ornament.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Müller.</p></div>

<p>The Votiaks have three principal divinities:
a Master and Supreme Lord of everything,
called <i>Inmar</i>; a god that protects the land and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the harvests; and a third god that has
dominion over the waters. Inmar dwells in
the sun, which is an object of their highest
veneration.</p>

<p>The principal fête of the year is in the month
of August, and then the grand priest known
as <i>Toua</i> proceeds to one of the sanctuaries I
have just mentioned, and there sacrifices, in
due order, one after the other, a duck, a goose,
a bull, and a horse. The horse should be
chestnut, though in cases of necessity it may
be of any other colour, except black. Afterwards
the faithful have a repast on the flesh
of these animals; then the Toua collects the
blood and the fat, and, putting them into the
stomachs, he burns them with a portion of the
bones; the heads are hung up on a neighbouring
pine, and the skins sold for the benefit of
the high-priest.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Pallas.</p></div>

<p>Before burying their dead the Votiaks wash
them carefully and clothe them in rich ornaments.
When they are about to close the
grave they throw in a few pieces of silver, and
say: “This ground is thine.” Finally, when
a member of the family is dangerously ill, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
parents are accustomed to sacrifice a black
sheep.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> As these practices are always carried
out in secret, it was not without much difficulty
that Pallas and Müller were able to penetrate
the mysteries I have just mentioned.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Müller.</p></div>

<p>It is the custom in Russia, whenever a new
emperor mounts the throne, to oblige the
Votiaks to take a fresh oath of fidelity. The
ceremony is curious. They stretch a bear’s
skin on the ground, and then lay on it an axe,
a knife, and a bit of bread. Every Votiak cuts
off a morsel of this bread, and, before eating
it, recites this formula: “If I should not
remain ever faithful to my sovereign during
my life, or should I rebel against him with my
free will and knowledge; if I neglect to perform
the duties that are due to him, or if I
offend him in any manner whatever&mdash;may a
bear like this tear me to pieces in the heart
of the forest, this bread choke me at once,
this knife pierce my body, and this axe cut off
my hand.” There is not an instance, says
Gmelin, of a Votiak having violated his oath,
although they have been so often persecuted
on the ground of their religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The road leading from Kazan to Perm
passes through immense forests of evergreen
trees. My journey through this region was
attended with a degree of cold rather severe.
The thermometer varied from twenty to thirty
degrees below zero (Centigrade). At this
temperature, a temperature not at all unusual
in Siberia, it rarely happens that the least
breeze comes to disturb the tranquillity of the
atmosphere. All the trees of the forest were
therefore almost perfectly at rest: the only
movement perceptible from time to time was
a branch bending down slowly to relieve itself
from a too heavy burden of snow.</p>

<p>This complete silence&mdash;this all-pervading
stillness of nature, in which she seems to
repose from the terrible manifestations of her
power, as in the tempest and in the billows
of the ocean&mdash;is not without grandeur, and to
the thoughtful, perhaps, if less imposing, is
more solemn than her other phases. On the
one side she presents to us vicissitude and
transitoriness, and on the other unchangeableness
and duration; the agitation and the
turmoil of the one may, indeed, remind us
more vividly of life, but the quiescence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
sepulchral muteness of the other draw our
thoughts nearer to eternity.</p>

<p>The aspect of Asiatic Russia produces on
the mind an impression not dissimilar from
that derived from contemplating the ocean, or
the African desert, and this is immensity&mdash;mournful
immensity.</p>

<p>To be lost amid this inhospitable, boundless
space is not to pine away simply from hunger
and thirst, as on the sands of the desert, with
some prospect, however remote, of relief; here
one dies pierced with cold to the marrow,
lingering without hope; for what hope could
exist to escape from a region interminable to
the desponding eye, whose glacial temperature
without movement means inevitable death?</p>

<p>With the muteness and unchanging aspect
of these limitless wilds is associated another
of a fantastic character, doubtless one of the
causes of the all-pervading superstition of
this country. In the depth of these forests,
which may be called virgin forests&mdash;not that
they are untrodden, for they are inhabited&mdash;the
snow falls very unequally. Here and
there enormous cedars preserve beneath their
branches large bare spaces; and farther on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the avalanches from weaker branches accumulate
into high pyramids. On one side
the wind rounds off the angularity, and on
the other it is pierced by protruding branches
of vigorous shrubs. It follows that the snow,
thus heaped up in these spots, takes many
irregular forms, which, to the excited imagination,
may easily become terrifying, especially
at approaching night, when these white phantoms
stand forth from the mysterious obscurity
under the spreading cedars.</p>

<p>When we dismounted at the end of our
stage, there was a little adventure that made
me blush, I must admit, for my French
gallantry. We met here two women, who
had been waiting the whole day long, till the
posting master was pleased to give them
horses to continue their journey. This autocrat
had at last relented just before we came up;
the horses were put in their sledge, and they
were going to start at once, when Constantine
presented our Crown podarojnaia order.
“That is my last troïka,” exclaimed the
master of the relays; “I shall be obliged, I
am sorry to say, to my great regret, to keep
you waiting here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“Take the horses out of that sledge,” said
Constantine authoritatively, perfectly indifferent
to the distressing embarrassment into
which he had thrown these two poor travellers.</p>

<p>I did not clearly understand the affair at first,
but I doubt whether, after having examined
these two personages, my gallantry would have
overruled my selfishness, for their departure
or detention depended on the one or the
other. If at night all cats are grey, in
Siberia all women swaddled for a journey are
uniformly unattractive; and the face, besides,
is disfigured with a look of uncleanliness from
intense and prolonged cold.</p>

<p>I do not know what Don Quixote would
have done in the presence of these two Dulcineas:
as it was quite impossible for me to
follow them, the only alternative was to
precede them.</p>

<p>The reader will soon learn what followed
from this incident. I am ashamed to say I
had the cowardice to approve, at least by my
silence, Constantine’s decision; and we continued
our journey, without any other adventure,
as far as Perm, where we arrived on the
26th of December at daybreak.</p>

<p class="center">Hotel accommodation in Siberia&mdash;A councillor&mdash;Opinions and
examples of Russian administration&mdash;National music&mdash;The
passion for aggrandizement of territory&mdash;Entry into
Asia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though Perm is still within the limits of
Europe, it has quite the aspect of a Siberian
city: the houses are constructed of wood,
without upper stories, and disposed without
regularity with regard to one another. Its
position reminds one a little of that of Nijni-Novgorod.
Overlooking the Kama from the
summit of a hill, Perm commands beyond also,
from the same eminence, an immense plain
covered with forests.</p>

<p>I put up at the Hôtel de la Poste. The
reader would smile, no doubt, if he could only
see the building to which I give the name of
<i>hôtel</i>. And yet the poverty of our language
obliges me to use this term: I could not give
the name of <i>auberge</i> or <i>gargote</i> to the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
important resting place the traveller could find
in a city&mdash;a city which is the capital of a
province as large as France.</p>

<p>In the way of familiar terms, the Russian
language has a richness almost disheartening
to those who have had the courage to commence
its study. Constantine would frequently
attempt to gratify his curiosity by putting
questions to me like these: “What do you
call in French, monsieur, a field of corn whose
ears are just beginning to show?” “What do
you call in your language a book that has its
leaves cut by the reader as he proceeds with
the reading?” Sometimes I replied: “We
have no special term corresponding to the
meaning of this periphrasis”; but more frequently
I said I didn’t know; preferring that
he should have a less favourable opinion of
my knowledge than of the comprehensiveness
of our language.</p>

<p>The walls of my room, like all those in
Siberia, were whitewashed. The furniture
consisted of a few chairs and a sofa; but no
toilet table nor washstand, nor even a bed.
This, in Siberia, is the traveller’s room, and
indeed, one of the most luxurious; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
sofa, here quite an <i>objet de luxe</i>, is often wanting.
Nobody, moreover, in this land of primitive
manners, knows the refreshing comfort
of reposing on a bed. At Kiachta, where I
accepted the hospitality of a rich merchant,
he found it quite sufficient for his night’s
slumber to roll himself up in a blanket, and
thus stretch himself on two chairs standing
front to front.</p>

<p>The substitute for a washstand and its
accessories is, to the stranger, even less satisfactory
than the makeshift for a bed. In every
hotel, this consists of a little reservoir of water,
furnished at the bottom with a minute copper
tube, and fixed against the wall in the passage.
The traveller, desirous of performing his usual
ablutions, lifts this tube, and a tiny jet of water
spurts forth and trickles over his hands, which
he endeavours to appropriate and utilize as well
as he can, though he allows it to “slip through
his fingers.” This cleansing operation, however,
is apparently deemed by every Siberian
of either sex, if not as effective, certainly quite
as serviceable, as the more elaborate process
of a Turkish bath.</p>

<p>I rarely experienced in the whole course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of my travels so much disappointment as at
Perm, where, after a long and fatiguing sledge
journey, I had looked forward to the refreshing
comfort of a thorough ablution, and found
nothing more than this trickling stream to
stand under. Knowing well it was perfectly
useless to go elsewhere in search of any superior
accommodation, I determined to enter my pro
test against it at once, and went out to buy a
big copper basin, which I procured, had
brought into my room, and insisted on having
filled with water. My ablutions then became,
more than once, the subject of very lively
altercations between the proprietors of the
hotel and Constantine. The latter, fortunately,
fully understanding the importance I attached
to them, took upon him my defence so warmly,
that he invariably came off victorious, but not
without strenuous efforts, and not without
much reproach for my <i>want of</i> cleanliness, as
manifested by the splashing all around.</p>

<p>There is also another very great inconvenience
for the traveller, and that is, there
are no means of ventilating the chamber: he is
shut in there with every chink closely puttied,
and the temperature raised to twenty-eight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
thirty, and even thirty-five degrees centigrade
of heat,&mdash;that is to say, the summer temperature
of Bombay. And since the winter cold
of Central Siberia is seldom less than thirty
degrees centigrade, one has to submit, on
going out of doors, to a difference of sixty
or seventy degrees.</p>

<p>When they had brought everything out of
my sledge into my room,&mdash;for when these
objects, however diverse they may be, are
no longer in movement they should always be
before the traveller’s eyes,&mdash;and I had almost
retired for the night, Constantine led into my
room a gentleman who was introduced to me
as a member of the general council of Perm.</p>

<p>A councillor, whatever may be his origin,
his rights, or his functions, seems to be a sign
of liberal institutions. This dignitary, with his
ideas savouring a little of decentralisation, and
an ambition to augment his prerogatives, is
not generally met with, except in democratic
lands. Therefore, I must admit, I was not a
little surprised to find, breathing in Russian
atmosphere, a man marked with the title of
‘councillor.’ I found him very communicative
and courteous, knowing thoroughly our history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and our institutions, and expressing himself
easily in French. He held besides the office
of engineer of mines. I therefore felt I could
enter into many subjects with him, and I
received some encouragement to do so from
the courtesy of his manners and his desire to
be communicative. Perhaps, under the colour
of holding similar views, he might have allied
himself with the old noble I met at Kazan
against the Emperor, reserving the disguised
power to get rid of the aristocracy when they
had fully served his purpose.</p>

<p>When I complimented him on the dignity
of his office, the exercise of which then drew
him to Perm&mdash;“I can do very well without
this honour,” he replied, “for our provincial
assemblies are far from enjoying the prerogatives
of yours. The Emperor, in creating them,
would fain make believe in his liberalism,
but in reality, he has given them but illusory
rights. In the first place, the members of the
council are nominated by important proprietors
in the province of Perm, who have received
from the Czar the faculty to send to the
sessions one or several representatives. The
president of the council is nominated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Government. It is in no case whatever
permitted to discuss politics. The Governor-General
of Perm may, if so disposed, disregard
entirely the wishes or votes of the council.
The council may, it is true, appeal to the
Senate of St. Petersburg, but the response is
invariable: it emanates directly from the
cabinet of the Emperor, and pronounces the
dissolution of the council. Our votes, therefore,
are very far from having the force of law.
Three times have we demanded some repair
of the road from Perm to Catherineburg: you
will soon see in what state it still is for your
journey.”</p>

<p>Among the interesting opinions with which
this agreeable and well-informed man entertained
me, I will mention one regarding the
finances of the empire. I expressed my astonishment
at not seeing in Russia, a country
supposed to be rich, more coin in circulation.
“The Government,” he said, “is wrong in
not seeking its principal revenue in agriculture,
and in the metallic resources in which the
country abounds. It has been dazzled by the
auriferous riches of the Trans-Baikal district,
and hopes with these to maintain its financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
position. A decree punishes, with the severest
penalties, proprietors of gold mines who
neglect to send to St. Petersburg all the
precious metal they extract from the earth.
The Emperor thus monopolizes, at its source,
all the Russian gold, and then reimburses his
subjects with bank-notes only. This state of
things can only get worse, unless immediate
and important reform be duly made in the
administration and in the distribution of the
tax. The budget, in fact, amounts to four
or five hundred millions of roubles, whilst the
State draws from the mines no more than
seventy-five to eighty millions of roubles. To
what rate of depreciation will not Russian
paper fall, if they continue issuing such a
quantity?”</p>

<p>This interesting mining engineer then turned
from finance to the more comprehensive subject
of politics in general, and added: “It is
impossible for a single man to know all that
takes place over such an immense territory.
But if the Emperor could indeed be enlightened
through the interpolations of a wise and
intelligent opposition, he would still take
good care not to introduce this element into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the Constitution. To give you an instance of
the ignorance of the high administration of the
empire, I will only tell you that I regularly
receive every year four thousand roubles,
officially as engineer, for superintending the
working of a Government manufactory that
has been closed for five years!”</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at this candid
avowal; and on learning this significant fact
it seemed to me conclusive and peremptory.</p>

<p>I thanked my visitor for his agreeable
society, and thought that this Russian proverb
might justly be applied to him: “No one lets
a bird of the Government escape without
plucking out some feathers.” I begged him
to introduce me in the evening to a sitting of
the Council General, and then went with Constantine
to visit an important cannon foundry
situated at about three miles from Perm.</p>

<p>The director of this foundry pretends that
the cannon turned out here are superior to
anything that has been hitherto made in
Prussia.</p>

<p>This sitting of the Council General was void
of interest, and soon ended from default of
speakers. The members, having replied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
their names, left at once to be present at a
concert given by a company of travelling
musicians under the direction of Monsieur
Slavenski.</p>

<p>The Russian people, essentially musical,
sing on all occasions. After a marriage ceremony
the guests mount into eight or ten
sledges and then make an excursion, following
one after the other in line, singing all the time.
They do the same at funerals and baptisms;
sometimes&mdash;provided the season is not too
severe&mdash;for no other reason than because it is
winter and there is no work to do. These
songs, which were executed by a company of
forty <i>artistes</i>, who travel over the country to
give their popular airs, constituted the entire
entertainment: their voices united an exuberant
richness to a remarkable simplicity of harmony.</p>

<p>The nearer one approaches an object he is
intent on, the more impatient he becomes; I
was longing, therefore, to tread at last on
Siberian ground. As the distance was not
very great that separated me from Catherineburg,
I imagined I should get over it very
speedily. But, alas! the Councillor was quite
right. The road was, indeed, in a deplorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
state. I do not know, indeed, how they could
give the name of <i>road</i> to a long course of land
whose surface was not level for a single yard,
and where wide pits succeeded each other
without interruption&mdash;not simple ruts, but pits
three, four, nay, five feet deep! The yemschik
has to calculate very nicely the fall of
the sledge into these pits, that the horses’
legs be not broken by the shock of the vehicle
shooting forward against them; then he has
to climb up the other side of the ditch, but
not without great efforts, and no sooner does
he get out of it than he has to prepare to dive
into another.</p>

<p>The reader may easily conceive what the
result of such a locomotion must be to a poor
traveller: he is doubly wearied on account of
the creeping pace accompanying the usual
fatigue. It took me twenty-four hours to get
over twenty-eight English miles! I was exasperated.
My hope was to get a glimpse at
the chain of the Ural Mountains, but a boisterous
wind swept up the snow and whirled it
round and round in moving columns reaching
to the sky; beyond a few hundred yards nothing
was visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
To pass away the tedious hours I began
questioning Constantine. “What is there in
summer under this snow?” “Grass.” “Of
what use is it?” “None at all.” “Who
takes it?” “Nobody.” “Who cuts these
woods?” “No one.” “Do all these lands
belong to any one?” “Not always.” “This
land then is not capable of producing anything?”
“On the contrary; it would be
very productive if they cultivated it.” “But
then, why has your Emperor such a passion
for conquest, when he can get so much out
of his own land? Why does he go in search
of gold in the Trans-Baikal, in the valley of
the Issoury, and will soon perhaps in the Corea,
as it is said among you, when he has at home
more abundant and surer sources of riches?
Why does he lead his armies into the burning
deserts of Tartary, that were formerly independent?
Why does he waste so much money
in the conquest of Khiva when he could make
far more on his own lands?”</p>

<p>When I waited for a reply to these questions,
Constantine, who clung like a burr to the
glory of his Emperor&mdash;and I congratulate him
for his spirit&mdash;gave me one disdainfully: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
can easily understand, that the French, whose
country is less extensive than our government
of Perm, should be jealous of the immensity
of our territory. You see, monsieur, that we
are marching to the conquest of Asia entirely,
which is the cradle of our race, and to Constantinople
also, where our religion originated.”</p>

<p>My companion was much offended; it was
easy to perceive that; and I held my tongue
to give him time to recover his equanimity.
An hour after this conversation, I wished to
see if he continued to have a grudge against
me; “How I long to come to the end!” I
exclaimed, “this long route tires me out.”
“Ah! Indeed, monsieur,” he exclaimed,
bridling up, “how grand Russia is! There
is not another empire in the whole world of
such vast extent!” “You are mistaken,” I
replied, duly estimating the lands uncultivated
and absolutely useless, we had just traversed.
“And which, if you please?” “The empire
of the seas!” I replied gravely. His flattened
nostrils then distended and quivered with indignation,
and I patiently waited to be greeted
with some emphatic Russian execration.</p>

<p>In spite of his <i>amour-propre</i>, Constantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
was, nevertheless, of a congenial humour,&mdash;towards
me at least. Sometimes he excited
in me a feeling almost of pity, which I could
hardly conceal. Just while we were passing
the Ural&mdash;that almost imperceptible elevation
that is called mountain because it is in Russia,
but which would be a mere hill in the Vosges,
a mere hillock amid the Alps, a ridge in the
Himalayas,&mdash;just here, we came on a village
of wooden houses, like all Russian villages,
but perched against a slope that gave it a
picturesque air. A little further down stood a
house of less wood construction than the
others, and surrounded with a few trees. On
this spot Constantine’s eyes were riveted in a
kind of reverie. “What a charming abode!
Those people should indeed be happy!” he
exclaimed. This remark moved me a little
with commiseration, and I wondered what
enthusiasm he would feel if he could only see
our smiling Pyrenees or our Norman valleys,
beaming with joy on a sunny May day.</p>

<p>Two days after our departure from Perm, on
the 30th of December, about nine in the morning,
we passed the boundary that marks the
separation of Europe from Asia. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
construction of stone, neither very high nor
very fine, but which strikes the traveller on
account of its simplicity and isolation.</p>

<p>Providence has decidedly withheld from this
portion of the Russian Empire the imposing
marks of its European limits. The quarters
of the world generally (their states also, not
unusually) have their boundaries defined by
grand and prominent frontiers, such as the sea,
high mountains, the desert, or some noble
river. But here the border of the Ural is so
little elevated, so unworthy of its <i>rôle</i> of
boundary, that man has thought it his duty
to interpose with his pigmy work, and say:
<i>It is here!</i></p>

<p>And here it is at last! We will enter with a
beating heart, and advance as far as possible
into the strange lands of ancient Asia&mdash;the
dream of every traveller. We will endeavour
to reach, as soon as we can, the shores of Lake
Baikal, Mongolia, and the frontiers of China;
for I fear my readers are tiring from the
monotony of my narrative, as I have myself
suffered since I left Perm from the monotony of
this long route.</p>

<span class="subhead">OUR PARTY ON THE ROAD TO TUMEN.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Trade and manufactures at Catherineburg&mdash;Carolling cherubs&mdash;Christmas
at Kamechlof&mdash;Grand gala at a posting
stage&mdash;Tumen&mdash;Its situation&mdash;Its gipsies&mdash;Fruit preserved
in ice.</p></blockquote>

<p>After we had been journeying nine or ten
hours in Asia, we arrived at Catherineburg.
This city should serve as an example to many
other Russian cities. Its inhabitants are very
industrious, and know how to turn the resources
of their land to account. They have
iron foundries and many other metal works.
They sculpture artistically coloured and transparent
stones that are found in the Ural in
great abundance, converting them into objects
of very good taste for domestic ornamentation.</p>

<p>The manager of the establishment where
these stones are so artistically chiselled, showed
me a chimney-piece of inestimable value that
had just received its last touches, and was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
be sent away to the Emperor. I asked him
who was the owner of the establishment. He
replied, “L’état.” “And who will pay for
such a marvel of art?” “L’état”&mdash;and he
added: “L’état payera, l’Empereur recevra.”
There are not many sovereigns, perhaps, who
have a better right than the Emperor of
Russia to say: “L’état c’est moi.”</p>

<p>When I returned to my inn, I heard that
Monsieur Pfaffius had just arrived at Catherineburg,
and that he wished to see me. I was all
the more pleased because it was something
unexpected, and I consequently lost no time
in paying him a visit.</p>

<p>And, at the house pointed out to me, I was
delighted to find again the courteous and
distinguished man I had left at St Petersburg.
“Do you intend starting soon?” he inquired
at once. “As soon as possible.” “Shall we
travel together, then?” “With all my heart.”
“Then that is settled.”</p>

<p>During the conversation two ladies made
their appearance in the room of the Commissary
of Kiachta: one of them was about thirty,
tall and as beautiful as an antique statue; the
other was less in stature and much younger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
The beautiful, luxuriant, fair hair of the latter
fell perfectly free and charmingly, methought,
over her shoulders. Her youthful countenance
beamed with freshness and vivacity.</p>

<p>“I am going to introduce you, if you will
allow me,” said Monsieur Pfaffius, “to Mrs.
Grant and Miss Campbell. These ladies are
also going to Kiachta, and I have no doubt
you will be highly delighted, as I shall be, with
their agreeable society.”</p>

<p>On talking a few moments with these fair
travellers, I learnt that Mrs. Grant was not
English, but Russian, and had married Mr.
Grant, an Englishman, at Kiachta; that her
husband had been obliged to return to England
for two or three years, she having accompanied
him thither, and that now she was just returning
to Kiachta, her native place, to meet her
husband, who was expected there, taking Miss
Campbell with her as a companion.</p>

<p>The latter, a young English lady, a little
adventurous, like a great many of her country-women,
had left her native land just as readily
and just as merrily as she would have remained
there, and now seemed to take pleasure in this
wandering life, though she could foresee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
neither the end nor the consequences of it;
and from day to day, penetrated still deeper
into Asia, happy in running about everywhere,
merely to see everything and pick up every
scrap of information. “Have you been fatigued
with the road?” I asked them, fully expecting
to hear bitter complaints of it. “Not in the
least, monsieur,” replied Miss Campbell, with
an air that seemed to say she was hurt at
the suspicion of having suffered from such
a trifle as the jolting. “Do you go by way
of Omsk to Kiachta?” “That would be
going out of our way to no purpose: we go
straight to Tomsk.” “You will travel quickly
then?” “As fast as we can.” “For my
part,” I remarked, “I prefer, on the contrary,
going on slowly.” On this observation her
eyes seemed to sparkle with some lively
thought. “Indeed, we should not have supposed
so.” “Well, and for what reason?”
“They say that you are exceedingly clever in
procuring horses everywhere.”</p>

<p>This observation made me open my eyes
with astonishment, and I added: “Even at
the expense of ladies?” “Quite possible.”
“Then you know one who has had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
misfortune to be a sufferer from my impatience,
at a certain stage?” “It is not unlikely.”
I could never have believed it if it had not
been positively affirmed. I could not believe
that the elegant toilettes then before my eyes
could in any way ever have adorned two such
figures so incapable of embellishment as those
that appeared to me at the stage between
Kazan and Perm. For they were quite hooded
and overloaded with rough and draggled fur;
so much like bales of raw hides, so little like
human beings, that one would never have
suspected that beauty lay there so many skins
deep. The reader will readily understand how
ill-adapted is the rigorous climate of Siberia
to setting off the charms of female beauty.</p>

<p>I warmly pleaded to be pardoned for my
conduct, and on behalf of Constantine, who
was the guiltier of the two, and the following
day we were all gliding rapidly along in three
sledges, one after the other, on the road to
Tumen; happy in the opportunity of chatting
together at every stage, smiling at the embarrassments
of the post-masters, which Monsieur
Pfaffius coolly disregarded, and facing cheerfully
the snow and the cold (those two enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
with which travellers in Siberia are doomed
to struggle), but without venturing on the
slightest murmur.</p>

<p>Of course the reader is well aware that
Russia has not accepted the reform brought
to the calendar by Pope Gregory XIII.; therefore
when we arrived in the little town of
Camechlof, on the 6th of January, at break of
day, it was actually then only Christmas-day
in Russia, and we were no sooner quietly
seated at table, taking our tea, as is customary
with Russian travellers at every stage, than
five or six little children entered our room,
singing Christmas carols.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen a more touching and
adorable <i>tableau</i> than this little group of fair
heads, celebrating, with the warbling pure
voice of early childhood, the most poetic
episode of sacred history. Is there really any
day more appropriate for singing? Indeed, I
have always thought that if God should, for an
instant, lift the veil from the supernal world
on Christmas Day, we should see passing, to
and fro, groups of innocents, around whom was
resounding sweet music, breathing peace and
joy to man below. The little children, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
thus agreeably surprised us at so early an hour
at Camechlof, suggested to my imagination
a flock wandering from this celestial host.</p>

<p>This vision, brief like their visit, had hardly
vanished when we saw appearing from the
other side&mdash;the mundane this time&mdash;a young
couple, accompanied by a nurse, carrying a
very young infant. “Ivan Michäelovitch,” exclaimed
Constantine. “Madame Nemptchinof,”
cried Mrs. Grant, and then followed
hand-shaking and embracing; we were again
among acquaintances.</p>

<p>This Madame Nemptchinof was the wife of
a tea merchant of Kiachta, who, notwithstanding
her advanced interesting situation, had
been to see one of her daughters at a boarding
school in Moscow; her son had accompanied
her, and the little being that had come into
the world during the journey was now on its
way to Kiachta.</p>

<p>In our country, undoubtedly, few women
would have been equal to the task of undertaking
such a journey, especially under such
circumstances; in Russia, however, such an
enterprise is not at all rare.</p>

<p>Then, before we had finished our tea, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
group of children entered, singing the same
song, but these would speedily have dispelled
any lingering vision of cherubs had any now
remained, for these earth-born, unlicked cubs
were clearly unhallowed and unlovely.</p>

<p>Having now sufficiently rested, we resumed
our journey.</p>

<p>The horse, placed in the centre before the
Siberian troïka, has its collar always surmounted
by a bow, which serves as a stay or
spring, to keep the shafts apart, and these are,
at the same time, kept in their places together
by a stretched cord. The collar, sustained
by the bow above and resting on this cord, no
longer weighs on the neck of the horse, and
thereby diminishes its fatigue. This system
of harnessing is really quite ingenious. Five or
six bells are generally suspended from the
bow, and the lively ringing of these relieves
a little the monotony of the journey.</p>

<p>Our departure from Camechlof, with the
bells of our caravan of four sledges in movement,
was rather a noisy one. M. Pfaffius
and his servant led the way; then followed,
in a second sledge, Mrs. Grant and Miss
Campbell; I occupied with Constantine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
third, and Madame Nemptchinof and her
<i>smalah</i> brought up the rear of the caravan in
an enormous closed sledge drawn by four
horses.</p>

<p>This part of the journey, if not the most
interesting, was at least the most agreeable.</p>

<p>We were a party of seven, and a very convivial
party too, that sat down to dinner in the
evening. The bill of fare contributed largely
to our merriment. Each of us produced our
reserves, and it was a charming picnic, that
furnished interesting incidents in abundance.
We brought forward frozen bread, frozen
caviare, frozen preserved fruits, and sausages,
so rigid, that they resisted any attempt to
yield, even against the knee, whatever force
was employed.</p>

<p>Let one picture to himself seven famishing
guests sitting round a table of thirty dishes
any one of which would inevitably break his
teeth if he had not the patience to wait for
the effects of a little warmth. But gradually
this element did its work; and in proportion
as each aliment gave way before it, a smile of
satisfaction beamed on every countenance, and,
when the point of the knife succeeded at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
in penetrating any part, shouts of triumph
announced a victory at hand.</p>

<p>Subjects of conversation were not wanting,
and, as I was French, and the Russians spoke
French well, to the great advantage of foreigners
not knowing the Russian language, French
was the sole language used at table this evening.</p>

<p>The youthful Nemptchinof, who had not
wandered much nor very far from Kiachta,
was the least conversant with French; knowing
Chinese and Mongolian well, he thought, perhaps,
this acquisition well compensated for his
ignorance of the Western languages. In order
to express contentment, satisfaction, approbation,
pleasure, he used but one word: <i>très gai</i>,
and he pronounced it only with great difficulty;
his accent made the expression still more odd.
“Si vous voulez bien m’apprendre l’Anglais,”
said he to Miss Campbell, “je serai <i>très gai</i>.”
This young lady, knowing French very well,
seemed to watch every opportunity that offered
her amusement by rallying him on his phrases.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, the incessant <i>badinage</i>
between the young English lady and her new
Russian acquaintance, that had entertained us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
so much with an occasional corruscation like a
fresh bottle of champagne, had subsided into
more serious and probably more genial intercourse
between the young couple&mdash;a <i>tête-à-tête</i>,
suggestive of the smoothness and tenderness
of Glinka’s music. This change led me to
speculate on the possible issue of an apparently
interesting flirtation, to which the <i>badinage</i> had
so effectively, though probably undesignedly,
prepared the way.</p>

<p>Whether I was justified or not in my conjectures,
Mrs. Grant took another view of the
matter, and, on mounting into the sledge,
whispered to me: “I am quite certain that
your M. Constantine is in love with my
young English companion, and therefore you
will never prevail upon him to go by way of
Omsk. I see clearly, as a consequence, that
we shall all form one party as far as Irkutsk.”
“Constantine in love!” I exclaimed with a
smile of incredulity; “that would seem to me
very droll, too droll to be probable. I am
disappointed that I shall be deprived of the
pleasure of your company <i>en route</i>, for I have
decided on going by way of Omsk, and
Constantine is so useful to me that I cannot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
I am sorry to say, dispense with his valuable
services and agreeable society.” Constantine,
as I gauged the nature of his sentiments, was
far more likely to derive gratification in contemplating
the influence he might exercise
over some fair victim to love for him, if he,
in his self-conceit, imagined it to exist, than in
indulging in any vague similar emotion in his
own heart. Mrs. Grant looked disappointed at
my decision. “You will not on that account,”
I added, “be deprived of the enjoyment of
a romantic incident; for, if I am not mistaken
in trusting my eyes, the young Ivan, no longer
<i>très gai</i>, is a little smitten with the graces of
your fair young companion, and he has been,
I think, so far favoured as to rouse the green-eyed
monster. <i>Nous verrons.</i>”</p>

<p>The following day we arrived in Tumen.
This city, like almost every other of the
empire, commands a river from an eminence
on its banks, and this river at Tumen is the
Tura.</p>

<p>Its only striking feature is that it is built at
the confluence of the Tura with another little
river, which is considered here as a mere
rivulet, one whose existence even is ignored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
by geographers, but which nevertheless is as
wide as the Seine at Paris, and of sufficient
force to have scooped out a profound gorge
in the Tumen hill to discharge itself in the
Tura.</p>

<p>A bridge has been constructed over this
river, but it is at the bottom of the ravine.
No care has been taken to diminish the steepness
of the opposite banks, so that, to ascend
the last, the traveller is obliged to descend
the first with great rapidity and maintain the
impulse over the bridge and for some distance
beyond.</p>

<p>The sledges accomplish this feat at full
gallop. As to wayfarers afoot, they descend
the slope generally otherwise than on their
feet and much faster than they like. The
cattle, generally so slow, roll down in a few
seconds, as if at the sport of Russian mountains.
Everything there goes down at a giddy
pace. The city offers little to interest the
stranger, but it has all the aspect of the East;
bazaars in the open air, in spite of the rigour
of the climate, call back to the memory those
of Syria and Africa.</p>

<p>In the <i>cafés</i>, the women deck themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
out, at certain hours, in silks, without divesting
themselves of their dirty petticoats, and make
it their business to sing and dance for the
entertainment of the guests.</p>

<p>In Africa, they are pleased with the bellowing
of the Arab <i>almees</i>, through love for the
picturesque, and because there is nothing else
to listen to; but in Russia, the country of
sweet and mystic melodies, I cannot understand
how these repulsive gipsies are encouraged
to raise their voices. Those who have
eulogised the gipsies of St. Petersburg and Moscow
are not altogether wrong in their appreciation;
there they are civilised, educated a
little, and, in some way, denationalised in
character. But here, at Tumen, they are in
their native element. I had the unlucky
curiosity to venture into one of these <i>cafés</i>,
and lost no time in escaping again, to join
with pleasure my travelling companions.</p>

<p>At the end of our evening meal, we had
some excellent fruits preserved in ice. This
method of preserving fruit is quite special to
Siberia. So soon as the severe cold sets in,
these fruits are exposed in the open air, if
possible to the north, where there is no sun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
reach them; they freeze completely in this
way, and are thus preserved, like meat and all
other fresh aliments, in Siberia.</p>

<p>These fruits retain their flavour, notwithstanding
their change from a state of rigid
congelation. When they are served, they are
as hard as wood, and if they fall to the ground,
they sound like a stone.</p>

<p>The heat gradually softens their texture, and
then they reassume their primitive form. I
tasted a pear at Tumen that had become overripe,
and then in which any further change had
been completely arrested so far as flavour was
concerned. This method of preserving aliments
seems to be simple, economical, and thoroughly
successful.</p>

<p>In summer, Tumen is a great place of call
for steamers coming from Tomsk by the Tom,
from the Obi, the Tobol, and the Tura. This
city is therefore a considerable mart for merchandise,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
its only claim, apparently, to notice;
for it has neither manufactures to interest the
curious in the useful arts, nor beauty of
situation to attract the lover of nature.</p>

<span class="subhead">A PERILOUS NIGHT ADVENTURE ON THE STEPPE OF OMSK.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">An ostentatious Siberian custom&mdash;The steppe&mdash;The cemeteries&mdash;Omsk&mdash;Its
situation&mdash;Its society&mdash;The emancipation of
the serfs related by a citizen&mdash;M. Kroupinikof&mdash;Visit to
an encampment of Kirghiz&mdash;Masquerade at Omsk.</p></blockquote>

<p>We left Tumen about eight o’clock in the
morning. Constantine, thoroughly familiar
with Siberian customs, had put into the
sledge several bottles of champagne, to provide
for what was about to take place. The
precaution was good, but the supply, alas!
insufficient.</p>

<p>To open a bottle of champagne is in Siberia
the greatest luxury that can be paraded before
admiring eyes. This is the consequence of its
high price and the caprice of fashion. In
America, it is said that “the keeping of the
proprieties is as indispensable as clean linen”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
here, perhaps, if doing <i>the right thing to do</i>
be considered as one of them, the clean linen
would have to give way to the proprieties.
A dinner, a fête, an anniversary, or any like
ceremony in Siberia without champagne, would
be marked as being wanting in its most
necessary element; and it is certainly not
here that common-sense is so robust as to
disregard the whimsical consensus of opinion
that holds the civilized world in subjection
<i>à la mode</i>, from Indus to the Pole.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Emerson.</p></div>

<p>About six hours after we had left Tumen,
we arrived at a place where we had to take
different roads. M. Pfaffius, Mrs. Grant,
and Madame Nemptchinof, were going to take
the road to Tomsk, whilst I had to turn a little
more to the south. In order to defeat this
project, Mrs. Grant had recourse to a little
manœuvre, which very nearly turned Constantine’s
head. With a view to dissuading
the latter from yielding to my plan, Mrs. Grant
had taken her place in the closed sledge of
Madame Nemptchinof; then she had arranged
to bring Ivan and her young companion
together, by making them mount side by side.
Constantine, who was apparently smitten with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the charms of the young English lady, seeing
her <i>en tête-à-tête</i> with Ivan, seized a bottle of
champagne, and cutting the wire, directed the
cork at his rival’s head, which Miss Campbell
carefully shielded with her great fur glove;
then the fire commenced on all sides, whilst I
wondered what unseasonable and scandalous
bacchanals were about to be inaugurated with
so much uncorked wine. Happily, however,
we tasted but a very moderate quantity. Then
all my companions, in conformity with an
ostentatious custom in Siberia, dismounted
from their vehicles, each of them holding two
bottles, and, advancing before my horses a few
paces, poured the precious beverage on the
snowy ground, just at the spot the skates
of my sledge were destined to pass over. I
scrupulously performed the same ceremony,
a ceremony too solemn to be profaned with
a laugh, which I could hardly repress, and
then I took leave of this very agreeable
caravan, but not without the prospect of
meeting again, either at Tomsk, Irkutsk, or
Kiachta.</p>

<p>As we resumed our way, but now in different
directions, I heard a few more detonations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
corks; and when the sound of the bells had
died away and all had vanished from sight,
Constantine looked at me most piteously. The
<i>tête-à-tête</i> had evidently left some rankling
effect in his breast that would have resisted
any attempt at consolation had I ventured on
so delicate a task; for, as far as I could see,
he had received no encouragement whatever
from Miss Campbell, and as, in this instance,
the wounds of self-esteem and slighted love
could not be salved with this same remedy,
having no other to offer, I left the malady to
cure itself.</p>

<p>What struck me all at once on this route
was its absolute solitude. The carrying
sledges bringing tea and other merchandise
from China and the products of the Trans-Baikal
to Nijni-Novgorod avoid passing by
Omsk; it would be going out of the way to
no purpose. It is therefore a rare occurrence
to fall in with a sledge in this district. The
snow, besides, is scarcely sufficiently beaten
down to admit of an easy march. Here, in
the absence of such movement, one is oppressed
with an impression of wild waste,
cheerless immensity, mournful silence. Gradually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
vegetation diminishes, becomes more
scattered and stinted, then disappears altogether,
and the traveller enters at last on the
great steppes.</p>

<p>But how changed during summer! Then
the steppe is an immense prairie, whose rich,
curly grass soothes the eye with its refreshing
tint, and protects the body from jolting with
its luxuriant bed.</p>

<p>And in winter, it is a vast plain rendered
level and white by the snow with which it is
covered. The French language, unfortunately,
is here again insufficient to explain in a word
the character of its outline. We call La Beauce
a flat country; now the steppe in its snowy
dress is not like La Beauce; neither is it level
like the Mediterranean in calm weather, nor
like the bed of a river. The surface of the
steppe is strictly horizontal throughout. But
Providence&mdash;as if to compensate in some measure
to the eye of the artist for the absence of
interesting scenery&mdash;has diffused, it is true,
over this bare country, some of the finest
effects of light with which any land is beautified
and resplendent. And yet, in spite of
this attraction, however varying and diversified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
its joyless aspect preys on the mind of the
traveller who enters on such a desert.</p>

<p>We had passed Ischim at nine in the morning;
about five in the evening, we had again
changed horses, when it was quite dark, and
wearied with fatigue, I had fallen asleep.
Suddenly I was awoke with a start by a fearful
shock that had as suddenly roused Constantine.
Our yemschik had gone astray in this frightful
wilderness. The absence of the moon and
the veiling of the stars with heavy snow clouds
were together the cause of this misadventure.
His fear of being underrated, and perhaps of
animadversion, had hindered him from avowing
immediately his awkwardness and blundering,
and for three hours at least, he had been
wandering about, where chance led him, with
the hope of finding his way again&mdash;a hope
poor indeed when he had lost all idea of
direction and every vestige of landmark.
The fall into a pit, concealed by the snow,
which we had just experienced, obliged him
now to avow his blunder.</p>

<p>Constantine and I unrolled ourselves from
our blankets, got down, and set to work, with
lantern in hand, to find the road. On looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
round, we contemplated the spectacle of our
sledge and horses almost buried in the snow,
and it was one of dire significance. Of the
sledge the only part visible was the hood, and
of the horses little more than their shoulders
and heads.</p>

<p>Sinking ourselves up to the waist, and
consequently unable to move one foot before
the other without great effort, having to battle
besides against the violent cutting wind loaded
with the snow it had swept up in its passage
and hurled in our faces, we struggled thus
desperately to see a few paces, as much as we
could hope to see before us, but to no purpose,
and were forced to return to our sledge in
despair, to breathe again and recover a little
more strength.</p>

  <div class="caption">PERILOUS ADVENTURE ON THE STEPPE OF OMSK.</div></div>

<p>After an hour of this painful work, we were
no more enlightened as to the way we should
take than at first, and, moreover, we were
exhausted. Over the land there was not a
vestige of anything but the snow to be seen;
for at a short distance all around there was
nothing but darkness, impenetrable; not a
star in the sky was visible, not a sound in the
air audible, to induce us to risk the chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
attempting one direction in preference to
another. The situation was portentously
critical, and, unless we would resign ourselves
then to our fate, it was necessary to make a
supreme effort. In this dilemma we consulted
together as to what expedient we should next
try. This decided on, the yemschik unharnessed
one of the horses with the object of
riding as quickly as possible in search of some
village, and began, with a lantern in one hand,
leading the horse with the other, to discover
afoot some trace of the way from which he
had strayed.</p>

<p>We watched him struggling with the elements
till the last beam of light died away;
then Constantine and I, thrown back on ourselves
in the darkness&mdash;a night with no day
near at hand, and a solitude without refuge or
clear prospect of retreat&mdash;had little to contemplate
but our dismay. We thought of our
poor horses exposed without movement, of our
inability to relieve them from the cold, and,
seeing how utterly helpless we were, we
wrapped ourselves in our furs and blankets
and re-entered our shelter. There we made
some effort to cheer each other. We saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
passing, in imagination, caravans of Kirghiz,
from whom we were, in reality, not distant,
and we fancied ourselves led prisoners into the
heart of Tartary, in some wild lawless territory
not yet brought under subjection. We saw
also&mdash;but this time it was not a vision&mdash;five or
six packs of wolves prowling around our poor
beasts, watching for a meal if they should be
dying or dead, but, happily, these prowlers
scampered away at the sound of my revolver.
The first shot was not without a moment of
terror, for I was not at all assured that the
result would not be disastrous. Having my
rifle packed up in my trunk through not having
foreseen what was likely to come to pass, I
found myself absolutely defenceless, in case
they should be emboldened, in the lonely
position we were, to join in a united attack.
Retreat we had none, except behind the
canvas; we might close in front; but how long
would this resist their assault, met with the
shot of a single revolver? Their disappearance
therefore was hailed with joy.</p>

<p>Many tedious hours thus passed away, and,
since our thoughts were occupied in waiting
for the return of our man, who might bring us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the relief we had not yet despaired of, every
hour passed seemed in the aggregate as many
nights in succession. He had long been
absent, when I began to be tormented with a
suspicion of his fidelity. If we ever stirred
from the spot and should be fortunate enough
to reach the first village, might he not there
expect a severe chastisement for the serious
consequences of his culpable neglect, involving
perhaps the loss of the horses, from which he
might think to escape with impunity by leaving
us to our fate? Then we thought of the small
store of provisions we had brought with us;
and, determined not to surrender ourselves yet
to our prospective fate of desertion and protracted
hunger and cold, I proposed to Constantine
to descend and follow on foot the
footsteps of the yemschik, with the hope of
extricating ourselves from our perilous position.</p>

<p>We had got out, and were on the point of
putting our project into execution, when we
perceived, to our horror, that no track could be
found. The blast had been strong enough to
sweep the snow across the path he had taken;
no depression, however slight, was visible;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
every vestige of a footprint had been effaced.
To wander from where we were, we should be
speedily lost; to remain on the spot, our fate
seemed not less inevitable, but as we had some
provisions and shelter, it would be prolonged,
and the return of day might bring us rescue.
“Let us wait daybreak,” said Constantine;
“then perhaps we may catch a glimpse of our
man in the distance, if he is still alive; for at
this moment, if he has not succeeded, he must
have given up further searching.”</p>

<p>We had been an hour, I thought, so well as
I could conjecture time, sitting side by side in
the vehicle, when I fancied my ears caught the
sound of cries in the distance. But it was so
feeble, that I trembled lest my excited imagination
should have deceived me. I replied,
however, though my voice was too weak, and
Constantine refused to join his to mine. I
thought he had resigned himself to his fate;
but it was fear, overpowering fear that closed
his throat. He yielded at last to my entreaties,
and then voices in response, the last glimmer
of hope, seemed really approaching.</p>

<p>After a little while, we attempted to shout
more intelligibly a few words, and then came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
replies. At last, to our infinite joy, we saw
our liberators. They were coming in great
number and with many horses, to rescue us
from our impending fate.</p>

<p>No mariner lingering on a wreck and watching
for rescue, in any sign of movement on a
lonely shore, could have hailed deliverers with
more exultation. Our spirits mounted now in
proportion to their recent depression. We
joked pretty freely on the stupidity of our
yemschik, whom his comrades now turned into
ridicule. The two poor beasts, that remained
harnessed to the sledge, paid dearly for this
adventure. When they attempted to drag
them out of the hollow, they were rigid and
benumbed with the cold; they could not follow
us a single pace, and Constantine understood
at once that these men had decided on putting
an end to their suffering.</p>

<p>Daylight had just appeared, when we made
our entry into the village. All the inhabitants
having heard of the great peril we had encountered,
ran out to see us pass, and bowed
and made the sign of the cross to the great St.
Sergius and the Virgin of Kazan in expression
of their gratitude for our deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Our journey continued this day without any
particular incident; the reflection on that of
the preceding night, and the congratulation
on our narrow escape from such peril, were
sufficient to engross our thoughts. The
aspect of this great desert, covering the
vestiges of many an untold catastrophe with
its snowy shroud, made me tremble at the
remembrance of it; and I have often thought
since that if our yemschik had not come to
our succour in time, the only abode he would
have had to conduct us to would have been
a cemetery. In the steppe, the resting places
of the dead are the only spots planted with
trees, and, on that account, are seen at a great
distance. They bring to these melancholy
spots birch trees from Krasnoiarsk, at a great
expense, and these little groups of white
trunks, glittering in the sunbeams, become so
many landmarks for the lonely wanderer.
They give also to this desolate spot, from one
point of view, notwithstanding the mournful
association from another, an aspect of calm joyfulness,
when the solemnity of the scene draws
the thoughts nearer to hope and resurrection,
rather than to despair and definitive annihilation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
When the sky is clear and the cold
intense, these cemeteries on the steppes are
radiant with reflected beams, even where everything
is luminous in the immensity around.</p>

<p>The following morning when I awoke at
daybreak, I found we were stopping on the
way. I opened the canvas curtain that closed
in the front of the sledge, to ascertain if we
were still on the road, and finding that we
were, I could not help laughing at the situation
we were in. The scenery had not changed;
it was still the steppe, and nothing but the
steppe around in view; but our driver was in a
profound slumber, with his head resting on our
provisions; the horses also, feeling themselves
allowed to have their own way, were standing
stock-still, and probably were slumbering also;
but as to Constantine there was no doubt,
for his snoring, loud enough “to frighten
the wolves,” proclaimed his happy condition,
and considering the exhausting effect of the
emotions he must have experienced, I was at
first loth to rouse him. Still this indulgence
could not go on very long with the prospect of
a journey of eighteen hundred leagues before
us, and having contemplated a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the drollery of this quiescent attitude&mdash;a
drollery all the more irresistible from contrast
with the seriousness of the situation&mdash;I resolved
to wake him and accordingly did so as gently
as possible. Now fully roused from his
drowsiness, he regarded the driver a moment
with irritation, and then, instead of employing
the bland proceeding I had adopted towards
him, commenced pommelling the yemschik’s
head with his fist, the only efficacious method,
he suggested, for a skull so thick. The horses
now, in their turn, were quickly set going with
means still more energetic and as we whisked
briskly along in the fresh morning air, I
admired with rapture those sublime changes of
light that invariably accompany the rising of
the sun in a cloudless sky in these latitudes,
and their reflection in paler tints successively
passing over the surface of the snow.</p>

<p>At last, after this eventful course, we arrived
at Omsk, in a cutting atmosphere of forty-five
degrees,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> an intensity of cold that scarcely
diminished during the remainder of my sojourn
in Siberia.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Nearly 50° of Fahrenheit’s scale below the lowest temperature
indicated thereon, = 82° below freezing point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p></div>

<p>Many geographers erroneously represent
Tobolsk to be the capital of Siberia, but the
honour belongs to Irkutsk. Tobolsk is not
even the seat of a Government, for Omsk is
the capital of Western Siberia.</p>

<p>I needed but a very short stay at Omsk to
congratulate myself on having chosen my
route by this city. This fortified place, for
such it is, is situated on the top of a little hill,
on the borders of the Irtish. The view, therefore,
is commanding over this river; then
beyond, over its opposite bank, which is
marked by a mound, the steppe stretches away
in front and on the right and left till lost
to sight in the horizon. The steppe, viewed
from this point, has not the same uniformity
to the eye which I before mentioned. The
snow takes here and there tints so distinct and
dissimilar, and these are ever varying with
such inimitable beauty and artistic combination,
that the steppe seen from Omsk is lovelier,
more diversified, and more imposing even than
the sea. A Frenchman, whom I have already
mentioned, and in whose company I have
spent hours in contemplating this magnificent
spectacle without ever tiring of it, told me that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
during summer, the steppe was still more
interesting. The grass, he said, takes changing
hues so deep as to be almost black; then
it seems that instead of a boundless green
sward, there is a vast gulf of immeasurable
depth yawning before the spectator; and then,
perhaps, an hour afterwards, according to the
position of the sun and the state of the firmament,
an illimitable field of brilliant verdure
rises under the eye, and replaces, as if by
enchantment, the mysterious gloom of the
bottomless abyss by the inspiring gaiety of a
vernal landscape.</p>

<p>The steppe, to the inhabitants of Omsk, is as
the desert to the wandering Bedouin, the sea
to the navigator, the Alps to the Swiss. They
search in its changing aspects for prognostics
of the weather, and these determine their daily
movements. At Omsk, the people have a
strong attachment to the steppe; it furnishes
abundant pasture to the flocks and herds, and
an exciting hunting ground to these ardent
lovers of the chase, who find here no lack
of wild animals. The public fêtes take place
here, and the promenade is in view of the
steppe. To go on the steppe, or merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
see it, constitutes, in fact, the chief occupation
of life for the inhabitants of Omsk, and, indeed,
when one has once seen the steppe, it is not
difficult to conceive this passionate attachment;
as for myself, who had very narrowly escaped
leaving my bones to bleach there on its snowy
bed, and on that account, perhaps, should
have been repelled from it rather than attracted
to it, I was probably more enthusiastic over its
charms than anybody, and it was with regret
and tender melancholy that I was obliged to
withdraw from the contemplation of a spectacle
so truly magnificent and sublime.</p>

<p>Society in Siberian cities is composed of
functionaries, who are deemed the aristocracy,
and traders and miners. At Omsk only is
there found a third element, a real middle
class of retired citizens, that is to say, men
who, having made their fortunes, devote their
time to study or amusement.</p>

<p>The first of these citizens to whom I was
introduced having spoken very favourably of
the decree of the emancipation of the serfs,
I mentioned to him the conversation I had
with the old aristocrat of Kazan. “This
gentleman has not told you,” he said, “all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the vexatious proceedings that the serfs were
constantly obliged to submit to by their lords,
and the extortions of which they were the
victims. He has not told you that the serfs
never had the right to quit the land of their
lord, how many cudgellings they may have
been made to undergo, and how often the
lords gambled away between one another, on
the throw of a die, a property consisting of
five or six families. He has not said a word
about the manœuvre of the lords, who, being
obliged every year to abandon to the service
of the Emperor a certain number of their
vassals, choose, as might be expected, the least
vigorous, who, notwithstanding the feeble state
of their health, become soldiers for life.
Certainly,” he continued, “we do not yet
enjoy complete liberty; we cannot quit
Russian territory before having complied with
the requirements of the military law; we can
change neither religion nor country; but after
all, every one is treated alike, and the sovereignty
of the Emperor is not to be compared
with the vexatious seigniory of the lords.”</p>

<p>It will require, certainly, great address for
the Czar to introduce, without violent transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
or revolution, the necessary liberal reforms.
It is to be hoped he may succeed, thanks
to the fetishism that surrounds his person.
He puts, perhaps, a little too much confidence
in the ever-increasing power of the trading
class, the possessors of the great wealth of the
country, who are still devoted to the Emperor,
on account of their hatred to the aristocracy,
but who might well turn against their benefactor
so soon as they found themselves in a
position sufficiently strong.</p>

<p>Another citizen of Omsk entertained me
with his views on another subject, not less
interesting. It was M. Kroupinikoff, who
had been fifteen years among the Kirghiz,
as Government official, charged with a difficult
duty.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz, whose territory is subjected to
the Czar, have, nevertheless, remained in their
wild state, and with a longing to recover
sooner or later their lost national independence.
In order to prevent them from uniting anywhere
in great masses, the Government has
assigned to each tribe a zone, and they are
interdicted from going beyond this limit under
penalty of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
It was M. Kroupinikoff’s duty to take care
that every Kirghiz kept within the bounds
of his respective territory.</p>

<p>To accomplish this difficult and dangerous
task, he had but an insufficient escort. “To
give you an instance,” he said, “I was attacked
and made a prisoner by these wild people, and
I don’t know what would have happened if I
had not fortunately made my escape, and,
indeed, without horse and almost without
anything to eat. This enterprise, probably, is
much more hazardous for me than another to
sojourn among the Kirghiz, whose character
on the whole is not ferocious. What they
detested in me was the functionary, and not
the man.</p>

<p>“For a period of fourteen days and fourteen
nights, I was exposed to the rigorous cold on
the steppe, wandering on foot, amid deep
snow. I was suffering from hunger, and yet
hardly dared to touch a morsel of the food I
had succeeded in bringing with me, for fear
the last crumb should disappear long before
I should be able to drag myself as far as
Omsk. But I arrived in a state painful even
to remember; for it was in this adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
that I was seized with the malady with which,
you see, I am now tormented, without a hope
of ever being cured.” This poor man, indeed,
had a nervous trembling from head to foot,
that did not allow him a moment’s repose, the
bare contemplation of which was sufficient at
the first glance to make one shudder.</p>

<p>“If you like, monsieur,” he politely offered,
“I will take you to see a Kirghiz encampment
I know, not very far from here; I shall be
most happy to have a little excursion in your
company; that will recall my old occupations.”
I accepted his proposal gladly, and early the
following morning we left in a sledge, and
took our way towards the south.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz anciently formed a part of
the great Mohammedan family, and roved
along the flowery banks of the Tigris and the
Euphrates. It is not exactly known at what
epoch, and in what disaster, they were defeated
by the Turks, and subsequently driven from
their old haunts into the great Tartar steppe.
They tried many times to reconquer their
ancient land, but only in vain. One expedition
of the Kirghiz is mentioned, that penetrated,
in 1738, as far as Tashkend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Müller gives us an account of some of the
institutions of these people during the period
preceding their final submission to the Russians.
When war was declared, the chief
named those who were to enlist, and assigned
them the quota of arms and horses they were
to furnish to the army.</p>

<p>In administering justice, judgments were
given by an assembly of elders. He who was
found guilty of murder first suffered the
penalties pronounced by the tribunal, and was
then delivered over to the relatives of his
victim, who were at liberty either to kill him, or
to keep him as a slave. In the latter event,
the assassin had to furnish to his masters one
hundred horses and two camels, with liberty
to substitute five sheep for every horse.</p>

<p>If the victim of an assassination were a
woman or child, the relatives of these had no
right to demand the life of the murderer, and
the fine was reduced to one half. The crime
of rape was punished in the same manner as
the murder of women or children.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz still have among them a great
number of diviners,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> in whose revelations they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
have more or less faith according to the
method these magicians employ in predicting.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> <i>Pallas.</i></p></div>

<p>Some divine with books without having
recourse to the stars. Others employ the
shoulder blade of a sheep. It is absolutely
necessary that this bone be denuded of flesh
with a knife, and that human teeth have not
gnawed it, otherwise it would have no virtue.
When one of these magicians is consulted, he
puts the shoulder blade on the fire, and makes
his predictions according to the fissures produced
by the heat. These diviners pretend
with their science to determine how far distant
an absent person may be.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz call the third class of magicians
<i>bukscha</i>. To obtain a prediction from
them, they exact a horse, a sheep, or a goat.
The magician begins the ceremony by chanting
and beating on a drum furnished with
rings; and whilst thus occupied, he goes
through a succession of leaps and contortions
of the body for half an hour. When this part
of the ceremony has ended, he has a sheep
brought to him, and killing it, receives the
blood in a vessel, expressly made for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
purpose; he then keeps the skin for himself,
and distributes the flesh among the spectators,
who eat it. He afterwards takes the bones,
and, dyeing them red or blue, throws them
towards the west. Then he scatters the blood
in the same direction, begins again his contortions,
and, after an interval, gives his response
to the question proposed to him. A fourth
class of diviners are called <i>kamtscha</i>. They
augur from the colour of the flame that rises
from butter or fat thrown into the fire. The
latter class of diviners is not much esteemed.</p>

<p>I had been about two hours on our excursion
in conversation with M. Kroupinikoff, when
I perceived three tents made of pointed
stakes, pitched side by side, and covered with
felt. As we had been some time announced,
the head of the family received us before his
encampment. This man was tall, and of a
haughty look, and his dress, composed mostly
of trophies of the chase, was really very
picturesque. His head was covered with a
hood of red wool, surmounted with a wolf’s
head stuffed, the ears of which, being turned
forwards, seemed as if they were his own.
His shoulders were covered with a red shirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and a wolf’s skin. From his waist hung a
pouch, similar to a Highlander’s, but made of
the skin of the white deer of the desert. His
legs were swathed in skins of different colours;
his sandals were of plaited straw, his feet
disappearing under leather gaiters, that expanded
below like Mexican trousers. In
imitation of the ancient savages, this man bore
at the same time his weapon of war and of the
chase. He had a bow over his shoulder,
arrows suspended from a shoulder belt, an
enormous club hanging from his waist, and a
falcon perched on his hand. This club served
him to strike down the wolves as soon as he
ran them down with his fleet courser. Near
him stood a hare-hound of a breed, it appears,
found only among these people. They are
hairless all over the body, excepting on the
ears, where the hair is of unusual length. On
seeing this one, I fancied it had been shaved
by the Kirghiz, who are very much attached
to these dogs, but M. Kroupinikoff assured
me that this was their natural state. These
animals, they say, are swifter and more intelligent
than Scotch or Syrian hounds. Excepting
the peculiarity of the long hair on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
ears, which detracts from their beauty, they
are extremely graceful animals.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz being Mohammedans, the
women of this tribe hid themselves from
our eyes in their tents. M. Kroupinikoff
being unwilling to displease the chief by
asking to be admitted into the tent, preferred
asking him to show me how he hunted the
wolf with the club.</p>

<p>He was in his saddle in an instant, and
executed before us a manœuvre with a dexterity
that would have been envied by
Arabs if they could have seen him. Off he
went, cutting through the air like a dart,
hiding himself from view by leaning down
close beside the shoulder of his courser, and
low enough to strike the snow with his tomahawk.
And the next moment, hanging on by
some part of the harness, he appeared completely
close under his steed.</p>

<p>This wild, wolf-eared figure, arrayed in red;
this sinewy, sinuous hunter of the desert,
guiding his courser, like the bound of a tiger
on some imaginary prey, was altogether a
striking spectacle, and one quite as interesting
as it was startling and fantastic. We bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
adieu to this son of Genghis Khan, and returned
to Omsk, with this vision ever present
to my imagination, like a vivid dream.</p>

<p>I was amused with a diversion quite peculiar
to this city, that takes place during the three
first days of the year. It consists in going to
pay a visit to one’s friends disguised in costume
and masked, in a way so effectually, that it is
impossible to be recognized. To give more
animation occasionally to the amusement,
families mutually exchange houses, disguising
themselves also, and then the visitors and the
visited find themselves equally mystified.
These merry <i>réunions</i> are generally accompanied
with dancing and refreshments. The
society of Omsk is too limited to afford facilities
for any intrigue, and too strict even that such,
if any, should be attended with any serious
consequence; but for all that, there are few
cities in the world, perhaps, where during these
three days so much boisterous mirth may
be heard as in this privileged spot on the
Tartar steppe.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE COLD ON THE WAY TO TOMSK.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The intense cold&mdash;Its inconveniences&mdash;The fine effects of
light at a very low temperature&mdash;The baptismal fête of
Christ on the Obi&mdash;Tomsk&mdash;Its commerce&mdash;An evening
on the banks of the Tom.</p></blockquote>

<p>I left Omsk on the 17th of January at one
in the afternoon. This day was intensely
cold; the thermometer indicated almost fifty
degrees! I could hardly open my <i>bachelique</i>
when I wished to do so, in order to admire the
fine effects of light that invariably accompany
so low a temperature.</p>

<p>The snow, through some optical effect I
am unable to explain, presented, from certain
points of view, reflections so dark as to be
almost black; and then, in contrast to these,
innumerable little crystals, reflecting the sun’s
rays, sparkled with such resplendence, that
one might fancy he was admiring particles of
diamonds scattered over a rich velvet cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
After a few hours of this journeying, we came
to a part of the steppe called the long grass,
on account of an abundance of it in these parts
reaching a great height.</p>

<p>When I saw it, it was quite covered with a
hoar frost. Towards evening, when the sun
was disappearing in the horizon, the mass
received the expiring rays and became dazzling
white. The snow at the same time,
disposed to take its hue from the sky, presented
a dark blue tint. This fine spectacle,
unfortunately, was of short duration. The sun
had now gone down, and a feeble, mystic
twilight began spreading over this immense
plain, which presently became illumined by
the aurora borealis, suffusing the whole with its
rosy hue.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to depict in words
the diverse and ever-varying tints I have
witnessed, from time to time, beautifying
Siberian landscapes. When the cold is very
intense, the play of light that enters on the
scene is far too subtile for art to give any
conception of it. It is during some of these
beautiful transformations I have mentioned
that the light vapour in the air freezes; at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
these times, I have seen shoals of fine crystals,
almost imperceptible, swimming in the air,
glittering in the sunbeams, and casting their
rainbows superimposed on the horizon. As we
see these colours in France, generally in a more
sombre sky, they are dull in comparison with
the lively, fascinating, and mystic hues presented
here on an azure of infinite purity.</p>

<p>A cold so rigorous is not without serious
inconvenience to poor human beings who
venture to brave it. The part of the face
around the nose and mouth disappears completely,
in a few moments, under a thick icy
coating, formed from the moisture of the
breath; and as it is necessary to remove this
glacial crust from time to time, the operation
occasions much suffering.</p>

<p>To prepare at night for sleep, the Siberian
wanderers are accustomed to moisten their
<i>bacheliques</i>, which speedily freeze and stiffen,
and thus present a solid partition or case, at a
few inches from the face. The respiration
then congeals against the inner surface of this
improvised wall. But in spite of these precautions,
when I awoke in the morning, I found
my eyelids completely sealed up with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
icicles around the lashes, which I was obliged
to dissolve between my warm fingers before
I could open my eyes to the daylight.</p>

<p>Another strange effect of cold so intense
may be seen on entering a village, at an early
hour, when the inhabitants are just lighting
their fires. The hot smoky air rising from the
chimneys ascends straight up to a certain
point, where, becoming rapidly cooled and
condensed and meeting with a stratum of
equal density, it commences spreading out
horizontally, on every side, like a kind of
ceiling or canopy, and this, increasing in thickness,
obstructs radiation, and thus forms a
protecting cloud for the whole village.</p>

<p>Between Kolivan and Diorosno, two little
towns, standing face to face on opposite hills,
the telegraph wires extending to Kiachta are
encased in a cable underground, an expedient
adopted to avoid repeated destructions of the
communication by floods which occurred when
formerly placed on poles.</p>

<p>The Obi freezes in the same manner as the
Oka; the protuberances are so exaggerated in
magnitude, that it is difficult to realize that they
cover the bosom of a river; they form, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
hills and valleys, obliging the traveller to
ascend and descend.</p>

<p>We arrived at Diorosno at eight in the
morning, on the anniversary of the baptism
of Christ. A hole, about a yard in diameter,
had been made through a thick flooring of
ice; and, through this aperture, the Obi might
be seen flowing rapidly towards the north, as
if seeming to make sport of the cold trying to
arrest its course on the surface. The clergy of
the village, followed by a crowd of devotees,
came in great pomp to this hole to bless
the water of this river. When the ceremony
ended, all the inhabitants drew near with their
buckets, vases, and vessels of all kinds, to fill
them and then carry away to their dwellings the
water that had just been blessed. When they
had all taken what they desired, three or four
fanatics divested themselves of their clothing
in the twinkling of an eye, plunged into the
freezing water, and dressing themselves again
as hurriedly, hastily ran home to warm themselves
at their fires. These people consider
it a miracle if one escapes without perishing
from the consequences of an act of such
rashness. I think that the short duration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the bath and the reaction subsequently produced
by the violent run are the chief safeguards
against danger.</p>

<p>After having passed the Obi, we entered on
a country of most singular aspect; it was still
flat, but inclined, an inclined plane, in fact,
that rose gradually, seemingly without end, to
the horizon. I think that the magnitude of
the rivers in Siberia arises, in the first place,
from the vastness of their basins, and then
from these prolonged inclined planes, that
facilitate so much the descent of accumulating
waters. Whatever it may be produced by, this
strange sloping land gives rise to wonder, and
at first brings on giddiness, especially when
one is gliding downwards. Although the
slope is not very steep, the sensation of slipping
down gently into some distant, unknown
abyss is unpleasantly suggestive of danger.
As the ground sinks under you, the world
might easily be imagined to have broken loose
from its moorings, and to be floating away
to some inconceivable destination. One is
instinctively urged to put out his hand to seize
something, but since there is nothing but the
bare ground in view, he is thrown back on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
himself more completely, and this singular impression
becomes all the more vivid and painful.</p>

<p>We had now been three days journeying from
Omsk, when, about five in the morning, we
were roused by some violent jerking from the
rugged ice of the Tom, which announced our
approach, accomplished not without difficulty,
to the city of Tomsk. It is always a great
relief in Siberia, after a long journey, to have
a resting place in view, and then to arrive
there. I made up my mind to stay a while in
this city, where the inn, by comparison, appeared
relatively comfortable.</p>

<p>The chamber they gave me contained nothing
more than is usual elsewhere, but considered
here completely furnished; still the
room was lighted by four great windows, and
the floor was well swept. Finding it therefore
rather inviting, I opened all my trunks, and
begged Constantine to keep me company for
a little time in this important centre of Siberian
commerce.</p>

<p>The city is divided into two parts, the lower
city lying in the valley of the Tom, and the
upper perched on a hill, running along the
right bank of this river. The first is the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
quarter; there are found the bazaars and
warehouses. The other, on the contrary, is
composed of elegant dwellings, at least elegant
for the country, occupied by those who have
either acquired large fortunes, or are on the
way to this enviable object.</p>

<p>In order to have a good idea of the nature
of the commerce of Tomsk and its importance,
it is necessary to have been an eye witness of
that disposition of the inhabitants of Western
Siberia for a <i>far niente</i> existence on the one
hand, and on the other, to know that absorbing
passion with which the Eastern Siberians
devote themselves to gold-hunting and the
working of gold mines.</p>

<p>At Irkutsk, the centre of this second part of
Siberia, the land is fertile, and yet not a grain
of wheat is put into it; the city is at the
confluence of three rivers, but, for all that, not
a fish is taken from them. Although there
are in the neighbourhood iron mines, and china
clay of excellent quality for the manufacture of
porcelain, all these raw materials are neglected,
and the material for building is brought from
the Ural, and domestic utensils from Moscow
and even St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
The inhabitants of Tomsk make profit out
of the indolence of the Western Siberians and
the gold fever of the Eastern, and become corn
merchants, forage providers, butchers, and&mdash;what
is surprising&mdash;the fishmongers for nearly
the whole of Siberia. The enormous distance
between Tomsk and other important cities, of
which I have spoken, might throw doubt on
the soundness of such a view; but this commerce
is rendered quite possible from the
curious effects of extreme cold on aliments.</p>

  <div class="caption">MARKET-PLACE AT TOMSK.</div></div>

<p>One day, on dining on a plump fowl that had
been placed before me, I asked, from curiosity,
how long it had been since the bird was
killed; they replied, in order to diminish the
natural repugnance of a Frenchman for anything
not fresh, “Two months only; not
more.” For beef, no precautions are required
to preserve it; it takes care of itself. Nearly
all the butchers kill, for a stock of fresh provisions,
at the commencement of the cold, a
quantity sufficient for the winter. There is no
fear of any fresh aliment changing under such
a temperature. It is the same with the fish,
which become so solid and stiff, that they are
set up on their tails against the walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
markets, be the tail ever so long and the fish
ever so heavy.</p>

<p>The climate of Siberia has also very marked
effect on the germination and growth of grain:
the sowing is done in May only, and in July
the corn is ripe for harvesting.</p>

<p>It is quite clear, besides, that the spring
here in Siberia makes its effects felt much
more rapidly than in England or France. If
one watches the trees, their leaves and twigs,
he will perceive very sensible differences in
the development from day to day. This
arises in part from the increased vigour of
a sap long dormant under the snow, but more
particularly from the great length of the days,
and consequent increase of sunshine, whereby
vegetation enjoys not only considerably more
heat and longer periods of diurnal activity, but
from the shortness of the nights, suffers a
proportionately less share of refrigeration and
retardation of its development.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> See <a href="#note_3">note 3</a>.</p></div>

<p>The inhabitants of Tomsk being always
occupied, and principally in the cultivation of
the soil, have, on this account, preserved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
more scrupulously than elsewhere, the ancient
Siberian customs. I will mention only a few
of them. In every house and even every
room, one or several lamps may be seen
burning before some picture, some object of
piety, according to the day or religious solemnity.
When a visitor presents himself he
bows two or three times, at the same time
making the sign of the cross before the picture;
then, but not before, he salutes his host in a
manner according to his occupation at the
moment. If he is eating, they say: “Tea
and sugar,” which signifies: “I hope you
will be able to put sugar in your tea.” This
luxury here is not given to everybody. On
leaving the room, they say: “Rest in peace!”
When the inhabitants of Tomsk enter a shop,
they make use of an expression of this meaning:
“I wish you may make a bargain with
me quite to your own advantage.”</p>

<p>Great quantities of merchandise are brought
from China and the Trans-Baikal and discharged
at Tomsk during the summer, to be
conveyed hence by steamboats to Tumen, and
this additional traffic adds considerably to the
wealth of the former city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Tomsk is, it appears, one of the coldest
spots in all Siberia. During certain winters,
the thermometer has been known to descend
to fifty-five degrees and remain for some time
at this temperature, and one is known even so
low as fifty-eight degrees!</p>

<p>When I was here, the temperature, on the
contrary, was less rigorous than during my
sojourn at Omsk. It snowed heavily for some
days, and that induced me to confine myself to
my room, which I in no way regretted, with
the discomfort of so many long days and
nights, just passed in the open air, still fresh in
my memory.</p>

<p>One night only, urged by some motive for
exercise, and perhaps adventure, I went out
alone afoot, and took my way, musing, along
the banks of the river. The night was very
dark, and heavy clouds veiled the stars; but
the ground was lighted up with the snow fallen
during the day. The frozen surface of the
Tom was nowhere even, and I was able to
account for the joltings we had experienced in
the sledge on crossing this river. Blocks of
ice were rising one above the other, sometimes
to a great height, presenting their edges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
upwards, and the aspect of having struggled
with tremendous force to escape from the
crushing embrace of the solid mass on which
they rested. It might be said to have been
the result of a terrific combat between two
great forces of nature&mdash;between the river and
the frost&mdash;the one visible and vanquished, and
the other invisible and victorious. Now, however,
this struggle was suspended till the time
would come for the victory to be reversed, and
meanwhile all was motionless and silent.</p>

<p>I stood regarding it with awe for some time,
like the pale visage of death on whose features
the convulsions of agony told some dreadful
tale. The night was too dark to distinguish
the other bank of this great river; and what
was before me, in its chilling inhospitable
state&mdash;total estrangement from the world in
this white solitude as far as the eye could
reach through the gloom&mdash;made me shudder
in my loneliness. It was the first time I felt
myself so entirely abandoned, so utterly cut
off from the world, exiled from my country
and home and all that was dear to me. To
think of taking to the sledge again, and continuing
my journey through this chilling air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
and darkness, made me shrink with repugnance
and fear. To struggle against such a force as
had stopped this gigantic river in its course
seemed to me foolhardiness. It was indeed a
true picture of the extreme North I had come
so far as Siberia to see; and although I had
gratified my longing as a tourist to see
wonders, I wended my way home overwhelmed
with this aspect of nature, and it required all
the brilliant sunshine of the morrow to brighten
my mind with more cheerful thoughts, and give
me some courage to resume my journey.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed peculiar to Tomsk was
the great number of Corean servants, male and
female, that are there met with. I asked the
governor the reason of this, and he informed
me that many natives of this land took refuge
among the Russians to escape from the severe
laws in force there. “They know well enough
that they will be well received among us,
for we have already a protectorate over their
country.”</p>

<p>This announcement of a protectorate afforded
me some matter for reflection. The Corea, it
is known, is only tributary to China. The
sovereign of this territory is opposed to Europeans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
who are not only not allowed to
establish themselves there in any way, but are
often persecuted by this tyrant with extreme
cruelty. The conquest of the Corea by the
Russians&mdash;a conquest quite imminent according
to the views of the governor of Tomsk&mdash;might,
if accomplished, occasion important
modifications in our trading depôts of the
extreme East. It would be an important step
towards the complete conversion of China and
Japan to modern ideas.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GOVERNMENT OF YENISSEISK AND KRASNOIARSK.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Wretched aspect of the villages of this province&mdash;The country
at last becomes hilly&mdash;The night watchers at Krasnoiarsk&mdash;M.
Lovatine’s three collections&mdash;A Polish exile’s ball.</p></blockquote>

<p>I took my departure from Tomsk on the 26th
of January. The appearance of the road at
first did not differ materially from the one I
had recently passed over.</p>

<p>In the villages, however, there was a great
difference. Certain details showed the absence
of civilization and industry of any kind. The
poor inhabitants, instead of admitting light
into their dwellings through glass, which would
be too costly for them, plug the holes with the
skins of their sheep. One may easily imagine
how little light can penetrate through these
small apertures, and how gloomy the existence
of these poor creatures must be during a long
winter’s darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
These dwellings are raised without any prepared
foundation, and are composed of posts
or beams bound firmly together. When a thaw
takes place, the result is a subsidence, and
these hovels, instead of falling down altogether,
being secured laterally, simply lean in a mass
on one side. In this position they generally
remain; for their inhabitants give themselves
no trouble to set them upright again. The
consequence is that the flooring inside is
frequently so inclined, that it is quite an effort
to climb across it. This accident, so very
common in this part of Siberia, gives a miserably
dilapidated look to the villages; the roofs
seem ready to fall over each other, or fall away
in another direction; the upper story in some is
brought down on end almost to the ground,
and in others the ground floor is thrown up on
an inclined plane to the height of first stories.
On beholding this disorder, the spectator would
suppose the village had been scourged with a
hurricane or an earthquake.</p>

<p>The day after our departure from Tomsk,
we entered into a vast birch forest&mdash;so vast,
that it covers all the central region of Siberia.
These trees, which in our country never come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
to any great size, and which we look upon as
some of the most attractive ornaments of our
woods, acquire here enormous proportions, but
at the same time, I must say, to the detriment
of their gracefulness and beauty. In growing
old, the bark of their trunks loses its bright
pale colour, which we are accustomed to
admire, and looks dirty beside the snow; and
then, when they advance to decrepitude, it
becomes quite black. The most noticeable
peculiarity of these forests is that they have
never been cut and turned to account. Such
an enormous mass of trees allowed to perish
is a thing unheard of in France. Here and
there may be seen huge trunks, lying on the
ground, or leaning against others, ready to
fall, or broken off half-way, attesting the
violence of some passing cyclone or the destructive
power of lightning. Enormous birds
of a black or deep blue colour, known generally
by the name of cock of the wood, roost on the
branches of these venerable trees, and then
may be seen huge owls, all white, turning
lazily their flat faces towards the passing
traveller, regarding him without moving, with
the utmost indifference. Here, perhaps, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
than elsewhere, is the domain of the strange
and fantastic, and it requires little effort of the
imagination to people it with all the fanciful
and grotesque creations of mediæval poesy.</p>

<p>We continued a long time travelling on
through this primeval forest, whose mournful
silence and savage grandeur disposed me
to muse rather than to talk. My companion
also seemed to have his thoughts engrossed
with something weighty; he was thinking of
the future&mdash;of his parents and friends he was
shortly about to join, and, what I suspected,
of Miss Campbell, who had preceded us on
this road. Mine, on the contrary, were rather
of the present and the past; I thought of the
long distance I had already glided over in my
sledge; then my soul wandered from the dark,
mysterious forest to the unveiled, prosaic
steppe, and finally went astray in bewilderment
at the immensity of this trackless space.</p>

<p>The surface, over which we were now
moving, was becoming gently undulated, then
little hillocks succeeded, and at last the
monotonous flatness disappeared.</p>

<p>This reminded me very forcibly how indifferent
we become in time to the endlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
repeated or continued scenes of everyday life,
however congenial they may be, and how
readily we wake up to even a bare consciousness
of them after a merely moderate interval
of their interruption.</p>

<p>Since leaving the Ural, I had been travelling
from six to seven hundred leagues over a
country absolutely flat, presenting some interesting
features, it is true, and not least the
marvellous effects of light; but for all that,
it was void of variety and life; and this novel
contrast revealed how dear to me were the
animated and changing scenes to which I had
been habituated, and how little, from too much
familiarity with them, was I then able to appreciate
them.</p>

<p>During the two days preceding my arrival
at Krasnoiarsk, I passed several hills, sometimes
abrupt and sometimes gently sloping,
and then again others rising to a peak high
over valleys, that appeared to me very deep.
My eye was at last interested in some change,
and could be attracted on the right by reflections
of sunbeams from the snow mantling
striking diverse objects, or repose on the left
in the impenetrable shadows. In short, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
monotony had ceased, and to the fatigues of
the journey had succeeded the excitement
of locomotion, the variety and life of picturesque
nature. At the view of this change,
I vividly felt how lonely and joyless had been
the dead, changeless plain I had left behind
me. I thought of the poor inhabitants of
Omsk, who look over the steppe so often with
longing eyes. It is not from a love for this
immense plain, it struck me at the time, but
from some vague instinctive hope, of which
they are barely conscious, though sensible, to
see beyond in the horizon the dawn of something
brighter than this endless uniformity,
and perhaps in such a hope they find their
happiness.</p>

<p>On approaching Krasnoiarsk, the hills rise
higher and higher, and become at last, around
the city, imposing mountains. We made our
entry into this capital of the province of
Yenisseisk on the 29th of January at three in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>As the day was closing in, I went out at
once, and was able to contemplate and admire
the picturesque position of Krasnoiarsk. It
is built on the banks of the Yenissei, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
meanders between two very high mountains,
whose precipitous sides give more striking
depth to the valley they overhang. It is in a
hollow at the foot of one of these towering
cliffs that the city is built.</p>

<p>My first impression of Krasnoiarsk was
therefore favourable. It seemed to me that
the inhabitants of this city, having such a fine
view of nature before their eyes, ought to be
gayer and more inventive than those I had
just left behind me, and my expectation in this
was not at all deceived. The society of Krasnoiarsk,
from another cause, however, might
have been thought to be sedate and little
disposed to hospitality, since it is composed of
Polish exiles having little reason for mirth,
and some gold-seekers, to whom anything else
than heavy glittering nuggets seemed unworthy
to occupy their thoughts.</p>

<p>I did not look up my letters of recommendation
to make use of them till the following day.
During the night, a singular and continuous
noise hindered me from sleeping; it was the
harsh clank produced by the violent shock of
two pieces of metal. The sounds were repeated
at quick intervals, and seemed to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
from one part of the house to the other. Conjectures
as to the cause of this strange noise
increased the excitement of my mind, and
contributed to keep me awake. The explanation
came in due course. It appears that the
Siberians here have borrowed from the Chinese
this strange custom of warning thieves by this
ceaseless jangling noise, that the inmates are
on the alert within, and that any attempt at a
burglary would be discovered and frustrated.
Lucky thieves who thus know which house to
avoid and which to pillage! Happy families
who have their ears charmed and their slumbers
lulled with such music!</p>

<p>The first visit I made at Krasnoiarsk was
to a <i>savant</i>, M. Lovatine, who has three
remarkable collections: first, a collection of
objects in stone&mdash;prehistoric stone implements
of the aboriginal inhabitants of Siberia, which
are quite similar to others I have seen in other
countries of Europe and in other parts of the
world. M. Lovatine seemed quite devoted
to this study, and I could well understand
the pleasure it gave him without being able
to enter into it myself. Next, there was a
numismatic collection, on which he gave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
some interesting explanations. I will mention,
among others, a medal struck under Peter the
Great, the possession of which at that time
exempted compliance with the general regulation
prescribed by this great reformer to his
subjects under which they were obliged to
divest themselves of their beards. Those who
wished to indulge in the luxury of this hirsute
appendage were made to pay very dearly for
it; for the Emperor was not indulgent towards
those who did not approve his orders: and
thus a tax on a luxury was obtained. The form
of this medal is rather singular, having a piece
nipped out on one side like a barber’s shaving
dish. The third collection was geological, to
which Siberia, with its abundance and variety
of minerals, could contribute largely. In connection
with this M. Lovatine had some
political theories, the principal of which was
that the further south people lived, the more
turbulent and the more difficult to govern
they were, and that Southern lands were better
fitted to despots.</p>

<p>The Siberians dance a great deal; balls are
frequent and very elegant, but they rarely take
place in private houses. In every city there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
are generally two clubs, the club of the
<i>noblesse</i> and the club of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, to either
of which one is invited to come and pass the
evening, according to his position, the <i>noblesse</i>
being composed of the Government functionaries
and the other of traders.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival at Krasnoiarsk, I
was invited to a ball at the club of the <i>noblesse</i>.
The functionaries not being numerous in this
city, they had invited a few of the commercial
class, and particularly some Polish exiles. A
ball of convicts seemed to be something incongruous,
but it would be an error to suppose
that the Poles exiled in Siberia are at
present all ill-treated, and that they while
away their time in weeping for their beloved
country. When I come to Irkutsk, I shall
have occasion to speak more fully of the fate
of the Polish exiles in Siberia. But now, here
in Krasnoiarsk, nearly all were members of
good society. Their political opinions, like
those of all Poles I have met, are, it is true,
extremely advanced. They had not only
taken part in their war of independence, but
had been nearly all implicated in insurrections
beyond the borders of their country; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
admired our violent French demagogues, and
found excuses for our Commune; but in spite
of these preposterous opinions, which ignorance
of contemporary history and distance from the
scene of action may have rendered excusable,
I found at Krasnoiarsk a society of enlightened
Poles and perfectly well-bred men. As
they formed the majority, the ball was quite <i>à
la mode polonaise</i>, and it is a kind of dancing,
in my opinion, that ought to survive for ever
their lost nationality. One never steps as in an
ordinary walk. To proceed from one side to
another, it is necessary to adopt the step
called <i>la polonaise</i>, rather difficult to master,
it is true, but which is, undoubtedly, very
graceful. The consequence is that in these
dances, and especially the <i>cotillon</i>, there is a
liveliness that is never seen in our salons,
considered the gayest in the world. As another
proof of the knowledge which the Russians
and Poles have of our language, I will merely
observe that here, in this city lost in the
depth of Siberia, when the ball was over and
we sat down to supper, a very numerous party
spoke no other language than French.</p>

<p>It is here at Krasnoiarsk that one begins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
become acquainted with a few gold-seekers.
I was first received at the house of M. Rodosvenny,
who, although enormously rich, is
here considered simply in pretty comfortable
circumstances, on account of his neighbour
M. Kousnietzof, whose mines are considerably
richer. After I had seen at Irkutsk and at
Kiachta the houses of Nemptchinof, Bazanof,
and Trapeznikof, the luxury of M. Kousnietzof
did not appear to me more extraordinary; but
knowing the cost of living to a simple traveller
in Siberia, and having gleaned some information
as to the cost of an elegant house in
stone and ironwork, materials that have chiefly
to be brought all the way from the Ural, I
was lost in wonder at this palace of M.
Kousnietzof, quite as extensive as our grand
Parisian mansions and almost as luxuriously
appointed.</p>

<p>To mention two or three luxurious follies in
which these great proprietors of gold mines
in Eastern Siberia indulge, I will refer to the
cigar ash receptacle&mdash;where the smokers in
the salon drop the ends of their cigarettes,
according to the Russian custom, after a
meal&mdash;composed of a pure nugget of gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
worth sixteen hundred pounds sterling, and just
in the rough state in which it had been found in
the mine. The Czar has permitted, in an exceptional
case, M. Kousnietzof to retain possession
of this nugget in his house, on account of the
rarity of such a godsend. The proprietor of
this treasure did not omit to inform me that
having had this precious receptacle for thirty
years, he had lost not merely the sixteen
hundred pounds sterling, but also the interest,
two thousand four hundred pounds, and, consequently,
this luxury had cost him four
thousand pounds. Having gratified my curiosity
by weighing in my hands again and again
this enormous nugget, I took leave of this
opulent family.</p>

<p>The next day, we found ourselves again
seated in the sledge with a journey of two
hundred and fifty leagues to accomplish without
a break, at the end of which we hoped to
find ourselves in Irkutsk, the capital of Siberia.</p>

<p>We started along the banks of the Yenissei,
and, on our way, observed some idlers amusing
themselves by line-fishing. Their process is
rather ingenious: they break a hole through
the thickness of the ice, and down this aperture
they drop one end of their line, the other end
being attached to a little apparatus gliding on
two skates like a sledge. The fish, on taking
a bite, sets this little vehicle in movement, and
thereby announces its simplicity. The remainder
of the performance does not differ from
that practised everywhere, and in the end, as
in many other ingenious contrivances, cunning
fattens on credulity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
A short time afterwards Krasnoiarsk disappeared
from our view, and then we found
ourselves again amid the most complete solitude.
The bosom of the Yenissei was really a fine
sight; it occupied the whole valley, which,
notwithstanding its width, appeared very
narrow and profound, on account of the imposing
height and steep sides of the mountains
forming precipitous cliffs along the shores.
In presence of this grand scenery, it was amusing
to hear the tinkling of our puny bells,
agitated beyond measure to announce our
important passage over the rough ice; it was
a contrast of the ridiculous and the sublime.
We went on in this way till we reached the end
of the ravine, cut by an abrupt turn of the
mountain, when we left the river and continued
our course eastward.</p>

<p>During two days again, the country presented
nothing to interest the traveller.</p>

<p>On wending our way through these pine
forests, extending from Krasnoiarsk to Irkutsk,
the trees of which are gigantic in height and
circumference, I supposed that they would
furnish to the Russian Government, whose
property they are, considerable sums; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
was mistaken. The Government allows the
peasantry to cut timber for their own use, but
forbids the felling as a commercial undertaking,
and particularly the exportation of this wood,
even for its own account and profit. But the
reason for this strict regulation is a mystery.
The Mongols, for want of timber, make use of
dried camel dung as a combustible, as the
Egyptians do in Egypt. The Chinese and the
Japanese have barely fuel enough to warm
themselves; the Russian Government therefore
might find a large source of wealth in these
forests, as well as in the coal beds of the island
of Tarakai. There may be valid reasons for
neglecting them, but of what nature they are
I have no conception.</p>

<p>One night, when the moon was pouring
down a flood of silvery light over the snow-capped
trees, we caught sight of a pack of
enormous wolves, about two hundred yards
ahead of our sledge. “Wolves!” cried out
our yemschik. “Wolves!” I repeated, getting
out my revolver and laying it down in readiness,
whilst I hastened to charge my rifle, which,
since the perilous escape near Omsk, I had
taken good care to have at hand, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
stowed away in some inaccessible baggage.
I had everything ready, and was waiting for a
serious attack. Being the best armed, I knelt
down beside the yemschik, with my revolver,
rifle, and a formidable big knife. The driver
and Constantine both smiled at me, and
wondered what feat of prowess I was about
to perform; and their smiles, evidently, proved
their experience. As soon as the wolves
heard us, they all stopped, turned round
attentively to face us, then watching us a
few moments without moving, and finding we
were drawing nearer and nearer, turned and
trotted along the road before us in the same
direction like a pack of tired hounds after
a good day’s run.</p>

<p>All praise be due to the lively imaginations
of poets and artists, to whom I was indebted
for a thrilling emotion! I waited with panting
breath for the realization of a long-cherished
exciting dream, and to become an actual
participator in those soul-stirring adventures
I had pored over many a time with fascinating
delight in the <i>Magasin Pittoresque</i>, the <i>Habitation
au Desert</i>, and many similar books, with all
their fantastic illustrations; and now, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
of a thrilling scene of real life, I had to content
myself with a spectacle provokingly prosaic;
for there was nothing more to interest me
than the tame march of fifteen fine wolves,
fleeing calmly at our approach, at a respectful
distance before us.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> It seems that the depth
of the snow in the forest impeded their free
course; and the poor beasts, consequently,
preferred taking their way over a road well
beaten down, even by their enemies. We
kept each other company, in this way, for
a mile or more, when the approach to a village,
with which probably they were well acquainted,
though not to the extent of the door latches,
induced them to turn off, and plunge into the
depth of the forest. Doubtlessly, discretion
more than fear was the motive for this movement
in avoiding conflict with a force directed
by the superior intelligence of man. What
better proof could there be of their sagacity
and just appreciation of valour?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> See <a href="#note_4">note 4</a>.</p></div>

<p>The villages and adjacent properties of the
inhabitants are all enclosed together. The
Emperor accords to each village a certain
portion of land, which is generally equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
distributed among the male inhabitants. In
the forest beyond the enclosure, they have the
privilege of pasturing their flocks, but are not
permitted to till the land. This apparent
liberality has not much significance, on account
of the immense extent of territory to the
small number of inhabitants; the little plots, in
comparison with the non-utilized soil, are mere
minnows to a whale.</p>

<p>But this act of graciousness, on the part of
the sovereign towards his subjects, is not
admitted by the Baron de Haxtäusen, who
maintains that the system had its origin in the
natural development of the mode of life of the
Russian people. “The Russian people,” he
observes, “were nomadic, and among the
nomads, there is no defined individual property&mdash;the
land was utilized in common, for
the benefit of the whole tribe. Then gradually
these nomadic hordes, established in Russia,
ceased their wandering life, and became fixed
in permanent dwellings, and it was at this
time that the pasturages became constant,
instead of temporary, as they had formerly
been. Then agriculture advanced, in combination
with the pastoral occupation and breeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of cattle, the ordinary life of the nomad.
But the old element of nomadic life was too
deeply implanted in the existence and character
of the people: it was a part of their nature,
and could not be eradicated. Pasturage was
carried on in common, and agriculture likewise
was carried on in common; all the members
of the tribe or of the community laboured together,
and the harvests were gathered by their
united work, and then distributed in equal
parts to every member entitled to share. In
Servia, Bosnia, and Sclavonia, villages may be
seen having the same principle in practice.
In Russia they have improved this organization
without, however, attacking the principle.
They have divided and distributed the land in
equal parts between all the members of the
commune, not in perpetuity, still for a period
of many years.”</p>

<p>The same author shows all the advantages
of such an organization: “It develops in the
people the desire to remain in the country;
it fortifies the sentiments of homogeneity, community,
fraternity, and justice, and love of the
country and attachment to a place. It
strengthens the ties of family life, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Russian villages, contrary to what is seen
elsewhere in Europe, a great number of children
are a source of riches.”</p>

<p>I have just mentioned that the Siberian
peasants have the right of felling timber in
the forests for their own use. Since they
obtain their fuel gratuitously, they maintain
in their houses an extremely high temperature.
In elegant houses, constructed of stone, neither
stoves nor open fires are there seen; the heating
apparatus is between the two surfaces of
the walls. The heat is transmitted by contact
with the surface, and uniformly from the
ceiling to the floor. This process has not the
disadvantages of our system of closed stoves,
and does not affect the head with carbonic
gases diffused in the room. In the peasants’
dwellings the wooden walls do not admit of
the same arrangement. In the centre of the
habitation is raised a construction of stone or
baked clay, and this, heated at the centre,
throws off the heat from the surface.</p>

<p>The women seldom leave their houses;
therefore they are loosely clad in no other
garment than a kind of dressing gown, like the
fellah women of Lower Egypt. This scanty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
clothing seems strangely inconsistent with the
snow on the ground out of doors. So soon as
the outer door is opened, the hot air in the
interior, charged with vapour, becomes suddenly
condensed, and forms a cloud around
the entering visitor for a few moments so dense
as to prevent his recognition. He makes his
appearance, as in the stories of “The Thousand
and One Nights,” wrapped in a cloud that has
accompanied his passage, and which is dispersed
so soon as its mission is accomplished.
At one of the stages where I stopped, between
Krasnoiarsk and Irkutsk, the heat was so great
in the travellers’ room, that in spite of the
season, a butterfly, some flies and mosquitoes
were fluttering and buzzing around in full
vigour.</p>

<p>I was informed that in this part of Siberia
the mosquitoes form very formidable enemies
to battle with. Constantine told me that
during summer here one is obliged to put
his head into a sack, and in spite of this
precaution, is often a victim to these terrible
insects. Madame de Bourboulon, who had
passed there in the month of July, mentions
these pests, and that travellers, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
horses, have perished from the effects of their
stings.</p>

<p>After having been on the road eight days
and eight nights, we penetrated at last into the
valley of the Angara. This river proceeds
from Lake Baikal, passes on to Irkutsk, and
finally loses itself in the Yenissei. As the
difference of level between Irkutsk and Lake
Baikal is considerable, though the distance is
only fifteen leagues, the current of the Angara
is extremely rapid. The frost, consequently,
does not succeed till very late and after great
efforts in arresting its lively course. Nowhere
else in Siberia does this struggle between a
running stream and hibernal congelation&mdash;the
arrest of motion and the transmutation of force&mdash;produce
effects so remarkable. In order to
become master of its adversary, the frost
attacks the running water at first from below,
beginning at the banks. It is in the bottom
of the Angara and contiguous to its shores
where the first solidifications appear. Whilst
these are spreading, little blocks of ice form
and float over the surface, and then these two
opponents gathering force, seek to join their
efforts in a simultaneous and combined attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
The river threatened to be stopped in its
course struggles desperately. Pursued and
being closed in, it rushes frantically onwards,
and if it could thus break loose and carry
its floating enemy with it, it would perhaps
gain the victory. But these restless foes,
increasing in size and number, maintain their
hold and menace further retreat. The Angara
has then recourse to a supreme effort. It
changes suddenly its ordinary course, and
leaping in torrents over the barriers, spreads
out over the valley, scattering its force in
every direction, as if routed by its implacable
enemy. It is then that the victory is decided.
The waters that have overflowed are speedily
overcome so soon as they relax in their retreat,
and are transfixed and congealed in an instant;
and those also, retreating along the course of
the river, weakened in body and velocity,
yield too in their turn to a terrific conflict of
eight or ten days’ duration, and there, at last,
repose under a white shroud, vanquished and
still, leaving monuments of might that strike
the eye with astonishment.</p>

<p>These mountains of ice are heaped up
on this river to a great height. They rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
irregularly, sustaining huge, jagged blocks awry
on their mass of contortions, presenting the
most singular and grotesque spectacle of
unaccountable disarray. The whole width of
the valley, on account of the inundation, was
filled with this startling convulsion of nature.
When my eye first rested on this wondrous
sight, the sun was shining through one of
these blocks, pitched on one of the highest
pinnacles, and produced a natural pharos of
dazzling splendour; here its rays, refracted
from innumerable icicles, coloured the valley
with rainbows, or there fell on minute crystals
of ice, formed from the watery vapour floating
in the air, and with these depicted two luminous
columns, that rose and melted away in the
depth of the sky. It called up in my fancy
that sun palace sung by Ovid, sustained by
shining columns. Had the poet, when he
described these marvels, already known the
bitterness of exile in hyperborean lands? had
he, like me, contemplated this strange phenomenon
in the same latitudes?</p>

<p>My arrival at Irkutsk was accompanied by
these grand fairy scenes of light, so startling
in their novelty and splendour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
This city is built at the confluence of three
rivers, the Angara, the Irkut, and the Küda.
Instead of being perched on a commanding
hill, like most other Siberian cities, it is, on
the contrary, placed in the centre of a circus,
formed between the mountains, that opens only
on the side formed by the course of the
Angara. Irkutsk is inhabited by the representatives
of a great variety of races, who
there retain not only their physical type, but
their costumes and manners; the aspect of the
streets is therefore extremely picturesque. At
every moment you pass on the way Buriats,
Tungus, Samoyeds, and then Chinese and
Mongols, and Mantchous and even some Kirghiz,
who have been permitted by the Government
of Omsk to quit their districts. But I
will first present to my readers the Russian
society of Irkutsk and the Polish exiles.</p>

<p>The Russian society here may be classed
under three categories: the functionaries, the
gold-seekers, and the clergy.</p>

<p>At the head of the first is the governor-general;
he represents directly the Emperor
in the whole of Eastern Siberia; he has,
moreover, full power, and his acts are controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
by the Emperor alone. This appellation
might lead one to suppose that this
supreme dignity must be enjoyed by a military
man; but this is not the case. In Russia, in
every department of the civil administration,
there are grades, corresponding to those in the
army, having the same designations. At the
time of my sojourn at Irkutsk the governor-general
was M. Silegnikof. I presented to him
my recommendations from St. Petersburg, and
he received me with all the usual hospitality
of a Russian functionary and the courtesy of
a great lord of this country. He appointed a
young man attached to his office to accompany
me wherever I wished to go or to be admitted.</p>

<p>Immediately after the governor-general in
the hierarchy comes the military governor,
who is not only commander of the troops, but
in a certain way Minister of War of Eastern
Siberia.</p>

<p>The first establishment in Irkutsk I visited
was the Lyceum. There is only one thing to
remark there, especially when free instruction
is the order of the day. There are no professions
in Russia free and independent. Not
only are engineers, as in France, Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
officials, but also the lawyers and doctors.
The Government gives them appointments
according to their rank, just the same as to
other servants of the Crown. People that are
rich, it is true, are accustomed to pay for the
services they receive, but a poor patient may
call in any medical man he pleases, without
being under any obligation to give him the
smallest recompense. The Government, contrary
to the general opinion, is desirous of
extending instruction; fearing, however, the
consequences of an education absolutely gratuitous,
it enters into an engagement with its
young subjects desirous of instruction, by
virtue of which it gives at first to the student
the necessary instruction, and this accomplished,
the latter, in return, is bound to give to the
State five years of gratuitous services in the
profession he has chosen. If the young man,
however, does not succeed in passing his
examination, he is obliged to enter the army
to acquit himself of the debt of five years’
service. As this gives undoubted facilities in
the choice and adoption of a career, it seems
to me a very ingenious organization.</p>

<p>Then I visited the prison, but it was a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
to make me shudder. To be bound not only
to Irkutsk, but to a prison in Irkutsk, is something
terrible. When I had contemplated the
features of these assassins and robbers, faces
no longer human, where, instead of intelligence
and sensibility, nothing but rage and thirst for
blood is seen depicted, my commiseration
speedily vanished. I lamented only one thing
here, and more than elsewhere, and that is the
pernicious Siberian habit of keeping the windows
always closed; certain chambers of this
prison were tenanted by seventy or eighty
prisoners without having ever been ventilated!</p>

<p>Before leaving this lugubrious sight, my
guide took me to the chamber of political
prisoners. There were about fifteen men there,
nearly all very young, thrown together without
any consideration, and probably for long
periods. Let us drop a veil over such unhappy
beings. Be it far from me to hurl any
reproach at the Czar; for, considering the
enormous responsibility that rests on him, he
must necessarily be driven sometimes to cruel
decisions, if there be no other means of securing
the tranquillity and welfare of his people;
but for all that, I tremble on thinking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
victims of these arbitrary judgments, of these
young spirits, similar to those misguided lights
led astray by guilty revolutionists in France,
and who so innocently imagine that true
liberty is to be found elsewhere than in
respect for law and order. If justice could be
ubiquitous and reach every culprit, I know
which class of offenders would predominate in
the prison of Irkutsk and in our <i>bagnes</i> also.</p>

<p>The wives of these prisoners are allowed to
follow their husbands into Siberia; they are
even maintained at the expense of the State,
but, at the same time, are subject to a severe
regulation, that obliges them, in the first place,
to renounce all rights proceeding from their
birth or social position. And in the next
place, they can neither send nor receive
letters nor money but through the hands of
the authorities. Besides, they see their husbands
only at fixed times and places. If the
husband is exiled for life, the wife can under
no pretext return to Europe. The local
administration has the right to exact from
them the most humble services, such as the
scouring of floors, and similar work.</p>

<p>On leaving here, I went to see the barracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
of the firemen. This corps, second in utility
only to the police in every country, is of the
first importance in Siberia, where the towns
are built of wood. An observatory surmounts
each of the four barracks of firemen at Irkutsk,
and a watcher is constantly there to give the
first alarm of danger. My guide begged the
commanding officer to give me an example of
the turn-out. He at once pulled a bell, and
ordered the hoisting of certain colours at the
top of the observatory. In two minutes,
neither more nor less, sixteen horses were
found harnessed to an engine and accessories,
and appeared in the court where I stood; and
five minutes afterwards, three other engines
arrived from the other establishments. The
rapidity with which fire spreads in wooden
buildings requires the promptest resources,
and these are furnished by sixty-four horses
bringing four engines fully equipped to the
spot in five minutes.</p>

<span class="subhead">IRKUTSK.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The gold miners&mdash;Their luxury; their wealth; their wives&mdash;A
few words about the clergy, and the code of religion&mdash;The
Polish exiles&mdash;Travelling maniacs&mdash;A dinner <i>en
famille</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have spoken of the gold-seekers of Eastern
Siberia, and given an instance of their prodigality
in the wonderful cigar ash receptacle
of M. Kousnietzof. The miners of Irkutsk are
still more extravagant in their fancies, favoured
by their greater wealth.</p>

<p>But it is not every gold-seeker that makes
his fortune; many even ruin themselves when
they have insufficient capital for the preliminary
outlay and this is not rewarded with immediate
success. It is rare in Siberia to search for
gold in a comminuted and commingled state,
and I doubt if the Siberians would trouble
themselves about so hungry a pursuit, at least
to their eyes, accustomed to see it in a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
occult form, and their hands to test its weight
more sensibly. What they here call a gold
mine is a place where great glittering nuggets
of pure gold are found here and there in the
sand, and where they may be extracted without
having recourse to expensive machinery and
chemical manipulation. The greatest accumulations
of ingots, though not at the surface,
are generally at about two or three yards below,
and where they may be won by open workings.</p>

<p>The machines, the most commonly used for
separating the gold from the sand, consist of
large inclined cylinders, into which the auriferous
sand is thrown and there submitted to
the action of a stream of water. The sand,
comparatively light, is soon carried off by the
force of the water, whilst the heavy gold falls to
the bottom of the apparatus. The smaller
particles of gold, too light to resist the force
of the water, and that are consequently carried
away with the sand, become the property of
the labourers.</p>

<p>The most prolific mine in all Siberia yields
<i>annually</i> one million two hundred thousand
pounds sterling! It is the property of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
proprietors only, MM. Bazanof, Nemptchinof,
and Trapeznikof. The latter, who is
a young man, displays beyond the others the
extravagancies of a millionaire that would
seem senselessly lavish in Europe, but which
in this country of exaggerated profusion do
not appear to exceed the bounds of reason.
Finding, one day, the road too muddy for the
wheels of his carriage, and being desirous of
taking the air, he had carpets laid down the
whole length of his drive. When he came
back, he had the satisfaction of regarding his
carriage and horses perfectly free from the
serious disfigurement of a spot of mud!</p>

<p>This example of luxury unhappily is imitated
in a feebler degree, though perhaps not
with a feebler spirit, by the labourers, the
effects of which are the more frequently felt
when they come home in autumn to their
wives, who have barely a crust left, and not
a kopeck to receive from the pretty round
sum earned by their devoted partners during
their summer’s work at the mines. M.
Silegnikof, the governor-general, has tried
to remedy this evil. An official nominated by
him makes it his duty to hold in deposit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
sums gained by these workers in the mine,
and to restore these savings to them on their
arrival at the village. The first year this
functionary received in deposit from the
miners of a single commune fifteen thousand
roubles. But since this organization had not
been generally accepted by those for whose
benefit it was designed, and had been resorted
to, it was supposed, by a small number only,
it may be calculated that the depositors had
gained thirty-five or forty thousand roubles,
from £3,500 to £4,000. If these thoughtless
miners would amend and acquire habits of
economy, they could easily become rich; but
these poor deluded creatures imagine that the
mines are inexhaustible, and it is by no means
clear to the engineer that the Government
is not equally credulous.</p>

<p>To show to what extent gold is squandered
at Irkutsk, even among the humbler classes,
I will give an instance. On arriving at this
city, I found I could not open one of my
trunks, in consequence of having lost the key
during my journey, and sent for a locksmith,
thinking I should have to pay about twenty-five
or thirty kopecks, such as I should pay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Paris. This locksmith said to my messenger:
“How much will your master give me for
this job?” “Two or three roubles, I
suppose.” “Then I am not going to bother
myself for such a trifle.” I was therefore
obliged to break open my trunk.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be asked why these lucky
mine proprietors do not go to St. Petersburg
and Paris, to get something more tempting
for the big nuggets they have found, and how
they manage to gratify their exaggerated
wants in the cheerless depths of Siberia. They
prefer, no doubt, to be seen and known by
every inhabitant of Irkutsk and Kiachta, than
to pass unnoticed in the immense crowds on
the banks of the Neva, in Hyde Park, or in the
Bois de Boulogne. I have already given an
idea of the cost of the merest trifle in this
land of gold mines, void of all industry. In
spite of the exorbitant price of everything, indeed,
perhaps for that very reason, these nabobs
indulge their fancies in building immense
palaces in stone, and in filling their apartments
and conservatories with orange trees, banana
trees, and all kinds of tropical plants, which
have been dragged half across the globe at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
enormous cost to furnish insipid fruit or sickly
flowers and some visible sign of wealth.</p>

<p>They must have grand pianos from Erard’s,
or the best makers of St. Petersburg. They
give magnificent dinners of a hundred <i>couverts</i>,
where sterlets, brought alive from the Volga,
are served in the most <i>recherché</i> style beside
the choicest wines France can produce. They
mantle themselves in sable, beaver, and furs
of blue fox, or even blue fox feet, a luxury
that involves the purchase of four or five
hundred of these animals; they shackle their
fingers with heaps of rings. In short, their
living, their clothing, their display in general,
are in complete and constant opposition to
this precept of Montesquieu, which they all
certainly ignore: “En fait d’apparat, il faut
toujours rester au-dessous de ce qu’on peut.”
And then their wives, whose lot, doubtlessly,
the reader will be curious to know. It is very
simple, at least from the husbands’ point of
view, for they are necessarily neglected.
Being absorbed with this passion for aggrandizing
their fortune, the pressing need of
satisfying ridiculous vanities, of what importance
is a wife beside a nugget? what are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
soft whispers of love beside the delicious
music of the gold in the cylinder? During
the summer all the lords are at the mines, and
their ladies are left to themselves at Irkutsk.
During winter the former are still absorbed in
their business, and when they are not these
votaries to feverish pastimes are at the gaming
table, watching the fall of the dice, and their
wives are still forgotten at home. There is one
thing very curious, and which in this instance,
though subordinate to a dominant passion,
proves, perhaps, the strong spirit of contradiction
in woman. The ladies of Irkutsk
manifest in no way a taste for the costly vanities
of their husbands. They are ambitious of
assimilating themselves to the ladies of St.
Petersburg; they learn foreign languages,
translate Jules Verne or Paul Féval into
Russian, and imagine themselves to be endowed
with high mental qualities. But the
instances are rare where these gifts and
accomplishments exist in reality and not
simply subjectively in the imagination. These
need too active an alimentation to develop and
fructify in so petty a colony as Irkutsk.
Mischievous intrigues and <i>cancans</i> form the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
staple of all the gossiping that usurps the
place of conversation. It would not be too
severe to apply to the society of this city the
judgment of Madame de Maintenon on the
society of Versailles: “Nous menons ici une
vie singulière. Nous voudrions avoir de
l’esprit, de la galanterie, de l’invention, et
tout cela nous manque entièrement. On joue,
on baîlle, on ramasse quelques misères, les
uns des autres, on se hait, on s’envie, on se
caresse, on se déchire.”</p>

<p>The gold mine proprietors at Irkutsk and&mdash;to
finish with these instances of the flaunting
of stupendous riches&mdash;the tea merchants of
Kiachta, gratify their passion for exciting envy
and wonder, in a way by no means displeasing
to themselves nor to the recipients of their
roubles, by considerable donations to the
churches.</p>

<p>At Irkutsk, the convent of St. Innocent
is the principal object of their attention. It
is quite <i>haut ton</i> among these millionaires
never to set out on a journey before having
made a gift to the monastery. Therefore, in a
few years, a stupendous church rose over the
tomb of the old Siberian metropolitan, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
immense wealth is now heaped together. The
rivalry between this convent of St. Innocent
and the cathedral of the village of Kiachta
is not at all inactive, and is certainly to the
advantage of both.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit, the latter bore the
palm. It is singular to find, in the midst of
a group of houses which in France would be
considered a mere hamlet, a church where the
altar is of massive silver and gold, and where the
<i>iconostasis</i>, hiding the sanctuary from the eyes of
the congregation, is sustained by fourteen
columns in rock crystal. These columns, each
three feet high, are formed with three blocks of
crystal a foot high and a foot in diameter, and
are very remarkable.</p>

<p>I will not enter on the subject of the
orthodox religion, inasmuch as it is not a
question exclusively Siberian. Certain writers
in France have given a deplorable aspect to
the manners of the Russian clergy. I am far
from assuming that the conduct of all the
Greek popes is irreproachable, for I have
myself seen several of them tippling and committing
even greater faults, but it would be
rash to deduce from so limited a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
isolated facts general conclusions. In what
hierarchy shall we not find lamentable exceptions?
The Russian clergy are distinctly
divided into two classes: the secular priests,
who may marry, but to whom are closed the
high ecclesiastical honours; and the regular
priests, who live at first in the convents, to
rise afterwards to bishops, archimandrites, and
metropolitans. The first live retired in their
villages, bringing up their children in their
homes in the fear of God and with a taste
for the ministry. The second are restrained
in their youth by a severe rule, and later by
the respect for their high dignity.</p>

<p>The most striking feature at the first view
of the orthodox religion is its organization as
a political power. In this empire of supreme
despotism, the Church stands out, <i>imperium in
imperio</i>, an actual republic. This republic, it
is true, is subject to the authority of the
Emperor. It is his will and pleasure to ratify
or not the decisions arrived at, but all the
questions are nevertheless discussed by a
synod, held at St. Petersburg, composed of
all the metropolitans. What could be more
ingenious than this system of complete dependence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
enjoying the appearance of liberty?
It would be interesting to conjecture what
would have been the state of Europe if the
Catholic Church had been thus subjected
either to the emperors of Germany or to the
kings of France. Frederick Barbarossa would
probably have made himself master of the
world; he would, in any case, have driven the
infidels, not only out of Europe, but from
Western Asia. It is also equally probable
that, without the authority and wise foresight
of the popes, the great revolution of the
Crusades would never have occurred, and that
Europe, then subject to civil authorities more
bellicose than warlike, more chivalrous than
politic, would have been swamped with the
flood of Islamism, against which the popes
alone were able to raise a barrier.</p>

<p>If the Russians, in adopting the religion of
the Greek Church, had not inherited its inconsiderate
hatred of the Roman, they would
certainly recognise this great work of the
popes. Unfortunately, human motives of action
absolutely prevent every Russian from embracing
the Catholic or any other religion.
Intolerant laws punish with the severest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>

<p>The Czar, invested in the eyes of his people
with an imposing sacred character, profits by
the inviolability it confers to dominate over
the revolution whilst accomplishing the reforms
he deems efficient. Liberty of conscience
is therefore a long way from the
advent of its enjoyment in Russia. May the
Emperor, in preserving the respect of the
masses, suffer no derogation in the eyes of his
enlightened subjects, who are already, as I
have seen everywhere, breaking loose from all
ties of religious faith, and who may well one
day claim by force, and before all other rights,
the liberty to embrace a new faith.</p>

<p>This religious intolerance is painful to all,
and especially to the peoples recently subjected
to the authority of the Czar, to the
Polish exiles for example, who, although
sincerely Catholic, are compelled to bring up
their children in the orthodox faith. Alas!
since the insurrection this grievance is only a
part of the sufferings these poor wretches have
had to endure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
They have, at first, been led on foot, with
their hands bound behind their backs, to the
spot of exile that has been assigned to them
in Eastern Siberia: some to Irkutsk, and these
were the most favoured; others to Yakutsk,
or the island of Tarakai, known to the Russians
by the name of Saghalien, or to Kamtchatka.
Many perished on the way, as may easily be
supposed, and those who were strong enough
to brave exhausting fatigues were, on their
arrival, thrown into the gaol, to keep company
with thieves and assassins.</p>

<p>It is singular to remark a circumstance that
clearly shows the fetishism with which the
Emperor’s person is surrounded; these assassins
at the gaol look down on their
comrades from Poland with the utmost disdain,
and often refrain from speaking to them,
under the pretext that the crime of the Poles
was rebellion against the Czar. The Russian
assassins have therefore, it seems, a kind of
conscience when it involves a question of
conspiracy.</p>

<p>The Polish exiles I saw here were submitted,
for five years, to the same treatment
as the other convicts. They were numbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
in red on the back, and for a mere trifle
were punished with the strait-jacket, or twenty
strokes with the rod. During five years, they
passed the winter in this prison I have
mentioned, sixty or eighty thrown together
into this horrible chamber without air and
almost without light, and the summer in working
at the mines with an hour’s rest during
the day and a nourishment barely sufficient.</p>

<p>Their lot, happily, is now much better:
except the liberty of going beyond the limits
of a certain assigned district, they enjoy the
same advantages as other Russian subjects.
They constitute, besides, at Irkutsk, it must
be admitted, the most intelligent part of the
population; and receiving no assistance from
the Government, they gain not only their
living, but sometimes even a fortune. They
are medical practitioners, professors, musicians,
or theatrical performers. Some even, who in
Poland formed a part of the aristocracy, have
taken to opening shops, where they sell all
kinds of objects from Moscow, St. Petersburg,
or Warsaw, articles which, brought from such
a distance, fetch a high price and reward
their sellers with a considerable income. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
among these enjoying the title of count, and
for this reason unwilling to follow from the
beginning the general example, was, at the
time of my visit, reduced to the humble occupation
of cabdriver.</p>

<p>Among the exiles I saw at Irkutsk, I will
mention, in particular, M. Schlenker, because
I met at his house certain persons already
introduced to the reader. This gentleman
was occupied during the day in selling linen,
cloth, <i>pâtés de foies gras</i>, wines, in short the
usual wares of a bazaar, and in the evening,
after the hours of business, forgot all his
affairs to become in his <i>salon</i> a perfect man of
the world, such as he had formerly been in
Poland. He took in the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i>, many French and Russian periodicals,
played the piano, and had ingratiated himself
with the military governor, with whom he
often went hunting; he was, in fact, a man
very well informed, and, having seen and read
a great deal, could speak in the most interesting
manner on many subjects.</p>

<p>To remember the date of any occurrence, it
was calculated from the year of his condemnation
to hard labour. Nothing seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
so odd and sad at the same time as to hear
this distinguished man say calmly: “I am
sure that such a thing took place at such a
time, because I know it was so many months
after I was thrown into gaol.”</p>

<p>And yet, fully alive to all these severities,
I must abstain from recriminating too readily:
in the first place, because I learnt on my
arrival in China that fresh liberties had been
accorded to the Poles in Siberia; and next,
because chastisements undoubtedly severe
have probably preserved Russia from great
evils and the necessity of making the punishment
still heavier if a more lenient one had
been found insufficient. We must not be blind
to the fact that the Poles are not always
patriots, and when they demand liberty, it is
not always on the side of law and order. How
many Poles were there not mixed up in our
Commune of 1871, and how many other lawless
adventurers shut themselves up in Carthagena
with the last Spanish insurgents! Russia,
that has these smouldering embers of insurrection
on its hearth, has been more fortunate
than France in preventing them from bursting
into a consuming conflagration. But I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
help pitying their sufferings, and especially the
sufferings of those who, with all their faults,
possessed in the highest degree the noblest of
God’s gifts&mdash;an intelligent head obeying the
dictates of a tender heart.</p>

<p>Having been invited to dine one day at M.
Schlenker’s, I met there, to my great delight,
the whole of the little caravan with whom I
had made my entry into Siberia. Mrs. Grant,
Miss Campbell, M. Pfaffius, Madame Nemptchinof
and her son Ivan Michäelovitch, had
just arrived at Irkutsk, and were about to
start again for Kiachta. Constantine was
also among the guests, as well as a young
Russian, M. Isembech, an intimate friend of
M. Schlenker, who was a complete personification
of those travellers in perpetual movement
of whom I have spoken.</p>

<p>“You are going to Japan,” he remarked,
“and I hope to have the pleasure of meeting
you again there, for I am going there shortly.”
“Come with me,” I said; “the pleasure of
the trip will be doubled.” “That will be
impossible: I must go to-morrow to the
Amoor river, and shall not have returned
before a fortnight.” “I intend to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
longer than that here, and shall have no
trouble in waiting for you.” “But before
going to Japan, I must go to St. Petersburg
for a fortnight.” “Then we shall see each
other no more.” “Why not?” “How long
then do you take to go to St. Petersburg?”
“Twenty-three days and twenty-three nights.”
“And you do not stop on the way?” “Four
hours at Omsk only, in order to transact
some business with the governor-general. In
two months to the day, I shall be here again;
it will be the time of the breaking up of the
Amoor, and then it will take hardly a month
to get to Japan; I shall therefore want three
months to accomplish the whole, and will meet
you on the 25th of June at the Hôtel d’Orient
in Yokohama.”</p>

<p>This hardy mercurial traveller had little
else than his winged feet, for the whole of
his luggage consisted of some linen and a
black dress coat.</p>

<p>The black coat, in fact, is here, even in
the morning, the costume <i>de rigueur</i>: from ten
in the morning to noon, the residents pay and
receive visits; at half-past two they dine,
always in formal dress; in the evening, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the theatre and supper, the same coat, and
one is obliged to retain the whole day this
inconvenient garment.</p>

<p>Our party at M. Schlenker’s passed off most
gaily. We recalled the incidents of our journey
between Kamechlof and Tumen, the fear we
indulged in on parting, the tender reminiscences
that followed; and when dinner was
over, our agreeable host sat down at the
piano to accompany the sweet voice of Miss
Campbell. Thus ended a delightful evening.</p>

<p>What delicious enjoyments are obtained
through a few days passed thus, in the interval
of a long arduous journey! One muses over
the adventures of the road already passed,
and speculates over those that may come;
the novelty of the scene and situation, the
society and topics of conversation, the fresh
direction to one’s habitual current of thought,
the total change, in short, of one’s surroundings,
brings an exhilaration that nothing
else can supply. Every incident during these
days seemed to gleam serenely in a sunshine
of poesy. And yet, when sensation becomes
thus more keenly alive to the enjoyment of
congenial society, we see in the persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
around us but the brightest sides of their
character, and the hour when the disillusion
comes we have already parted each on our way.
How many perfections of this kind have I not
met with on my route which, unhappily, I have
never had the chance to live with more than
one short day!</p>

<span class="subhead">ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BY A POLISH EXILE.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Why the Polish exiles cannot escape&mdash;Narrative of a
attempt by M. Bohdanovitch&mdash;Encounter with a bear&mdash;Sanitary
arrangements in Siberia&mdash;Wolf hunts&mdash;A blue

for displaying riches.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the description I have just given of
the mode of life of M. Schlenker, the question
may occur to the reader why the Poles
banished in Siberia do not avail themselves
of the quasi-liberty they enjoy at present
to effect their escape. They could not, it
is true, return to their own country, but no
doubt they would like to live in some other
land of their free choice, where the climate
would be less rigorous than that of Siberia;
such a favour, however, would not be accorded.</p>

<p>But Siberia is barely inhabited, except in
the neighbourhood of the great highway that
leads from the Ural to the banks of the Amoor
and to its mouth. All the rest of this vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
territory, known under the same denomination,&mdash;excepting,
perhaps, that also along the banks
of the rivers,&mdash;is nothing but an immense wild
tract of steppes and forests.</p>

<p>The frontier, moreover, that separates the
Russian empire from the Chinese, is formed
of a chain of mountains very elevated and by
no means easily accessible. And even if the
poor fugitive should succeed in reaching the
frontier, he would find himself afterwards in
the great desert of Gobi, without shelter,
without provisions, and even without a passport,
necessary for admission into China
proper; he would then have to dread being
placed under restraint there, infinitely more
terrible than exile in Siberia or, what is more
likely, extradition, followed by a fresh incarceration,
and then perpetual exile to
Kamtchatka or the island of Tarakai.</p>

<p>On arriving at Irkutsk, I was indisposed,
in consequence of the fatigue from so long
a journey in a sledge. During these long,
gloomy days,&mdash;for nothing is more depressing
and painful than illness far away from home
and in loneliness,&mdash;I frequently had a visit
from a Polish exile, who, having formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
lived in France, was delighted to come and
chat away an hour about the places where
he had passed his youth, and the happy days
he had known during his eventful and troublous
life. His name was Bohdanovitch. Our long
conversations were a great solace, and an
effective means of dispelling <i>ennui</i>. Among
all those of his nation exiled in Siberia, he was
the only one who seemed doomed to suffer
perpetually from the bare exile itself. He
spoke of the prison with the utmost indifference;
he repeated many times that he would
willingly give all his fortune to see France
again, especially Poitou, where he had lived
a long while, and whence he had set out to
join in the Polish insurrection to please his
father, who urged it against his son’s will.</p>

<p>As soon as he was free in Irkutsk, such
a man could not resist the temptation to
regain France. He gave me an interesting
narrative of this attempt, which I will reproduce
in his own words:</p>

<div id="ip_224" class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;"><img src="images/i263.jpg" width="474" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">BURIAT MAN AND WOMAN. (<i><a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>.</i>)</div></div>

<p>“Two of my countrymen and myself had
resolved, in the month of April, 1871, to reach
China through the forests. We succeeded in
procuring rifles, though it was forbidden by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the regulations to carry arms.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> We obtained
also some enormous knives, and having everything
in readiness, we attempted, at the end of
May, to put our project into execution. At
this time of the year, unfortunately, the thaw
that has set in is still too recent, and the
land consequently too swampy, to enable any
one to accomplish forced marches. We were
therefore compelled to return to Irkutsk,
hiding our rifles under our clothes, fearing
every moment to be suspected and searched.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> See <a href="#note_6">note 6</a>.</p></div>

<p>“Our absence did not escape observation,
but, since our project of fleeing from exile was
not for a moment suspected, one so rash
being here regarded as impracticable, we were
simply reprimanded. After this time a numerous
patrol was moving all over the country,
and so discouraged us, that we thought many
times of abandoning the enterprise. Our
courage, however, in the end prevailed over
our apprehensions, and during one fine night in
June, we slipped out of the town unobserved.</p>

<p>“All the provisions we had with us were
contained in wallets, which we had to throw
over our shoulders; for the thick, obstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
woods of Siberia, untrodden by the foot of man,
are not, except by wild beasts easy to penetrate.
We easily crossed the Angara, making
the ferrymen believe we had come from
Yakutsk, and were on a pilgrimage to the
convent of St. Innocent.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Hardly had we
landed on the opposite bank when we left the
road and plunged into the depth of the forest
and, as soon as we thought ourselves sufficiently
advanced to be safe from any possible
pursuit, we made a halt, to pour out our pent-up
feelings on the exciting and momentous
event. Tears of joy were trickling down our
cheeks; we believed ourselves free at last!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> See <a href="#note_7">note 7</a>.</p></div>

<p>“Never shall I forget,” he here passionately
exclaimed with all the bitterness of the recollection,
“this moment of enthusiastic joy,
which, alas! was followed by such bitter grief!
We made vows to each other of mutual aid and
protection till death, and continued our forced
march towards the south.</p>

<p>“During the first few days, we were in high
spirits, and leapt with joy. When night came,
we regretted a little, it is true, not being able
to find some shelter, even if it were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
under a tent, to repose from the fatigues of
the day. Our meal, however, composed of
provisions still fresh, restored our strength,
and cheered us with the hope of overcoming
all difficulties in soon reaching the frontiers of
China. How many enchanting dreams had
we then, how many alluring projects of the
future, which, alas! for my two poor companions,
were to change into a painful and
premature death, and for me into a banishment
which I now believe to be perpetual!</p>

<p>“When the first few bright days had passed,
we were assailed with a heavy and continuous
rain. Our clothing was very soon wet through,
impeding thereby our march; and the fire,
which we could only succeed in lighting every
evening after repeated failures, was far too
feeble to dry them. Sleeping thus, wrapped in
our wet clothing and without shelter, we found
on awaking, in the morning, our limbs so
benumbed with the cold as to seriously impede
our movements. In this state, fever was not
long in making its appearance, to threaten the
remnant of our strength and render us incapable
perhaps of further movement; and to
aggravate the whole, our stock of provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
was sensibly diminishing. To eke out this
scanty supply as well as possible, we had
recourse several times to hunting, but this
had the disadvantage of retarding our march.</p>

<p>“And then the animals did not often show
themselves in these regions, except the cock
of the woods, which could only be brought
down on taking the greatest precautions. As
soon as the hunter perceives one of these
birds, he immediately stops short, and remains
completely motionless till the moment it begins
to crow. As soon as it commences to make
its note heard, its senses of hearing and seeing,
which are very quick and acute, are, in a
certain way, diverted and, as it were, bewildered.
This is the moment to advance.
But if the hunter, in his progress, should make
the least movement the instant the crowing
has ended, he is unerringly discovered, and
then loses all the expected fruit of his patience.
We were able to get near a very great number
of cocks, and, luckily, had a good shot sometimes;
but it was necessary to sacrifice many
precious hours merely for a single bird.</p>

<p>“Near the banks of a little river, which we
were obliged to cross by swimming&mdash;an incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
that very much increased our fevers&mdash;we
fell in with a few hares, half yellow and
half white, a colour determined by the season.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
But all these resources in no way compensated
for the fatigue we had to endure in marching,
the weakness from the fever, and the discomfort
from the rain; and when we arrived at the
foot of the chain of mountains that marked
the limits of Siberia, our limbs began to fail
so much that we could hardly manage to drag
ourselves along. We had brought with us a
large quantity of brandy, and a little of this
stimulated us to further exertion, but the stock
of it was diminishing rapidly, and when we
had arrived about half-way over the chain of
mountains, where all vegetation but grass disappeared,
and with bare inhospitable rocks
before us, the remainder of this and our other
provisions was exhausted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> See <a href="#note_8">note 8</a>.</p></div>

<p>“My two unhappy companions, feeling
themselves unable to proceed any further,
were obliged to lie down to rest before making
any renewed attempt, but alas! it was the
final one, for they rose no more! I watched
two days over their cruel sufferings, striving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
to soothe them and to allay their agony, and
at last heard their dying murmurs and consoled
them with my tears. With my enfeebled
arms, I buried them in the best way I could,
and I made two rough crosses, which I planted
over their graves. Then, when this tragic end
of my comrades was consummated, and feeling
all the horror of my loneliness and the impossibility
of continuing to live beyond the
forest without provisions, I took the resolution
to retrace my steps, and to attempt to get
back to Irkutsk, in spite of the dungeon cell,
in spite of the renewed sufferings, that would
infallibly await me there.</p>

<p>“But before quitting this fatal spot,” exclaimed
this poor fellow with a shudder of
abhorrence, “I heaped maledictions on the
crests of those mountains that rose before me
to dispute my way like a battalion of Russian
gendarmes, and there shut out from my
longing eyes the sight of some other land
that was to give me life and liberty.”</p>

<p>“But this empire,” I replied, “is not so
hard, since it has not punished you for your
rebellion.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” he said; “they have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
only pardoned me on account of the sufferings I
had endured, but they have even given me more
liberty, knowing full well,” he added sorrowfully,
“that I should never renew so rash an attempt.”</p>

<p>I then asked him what miraculous intervention
enabled him to get back alive.</p>

<p>“I was indebted for that to my robust
constitution. I managed to live upon roots,
and gum from the trees, and that little red
fruit with which the Siberians make a sort of
wine.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> I was so weak that I could march
only very slowly, but the rain having ceased,
I began to gain a little more strength, notwithstanding
the miserable nourishment I was
forced to subsist on. When I arrived as far
as the little river I mentioned, I took it into
my head to construct a small raft, that I might
float down the current, and thereby diminish
my fatigues. I succeeded, after a great deal
of trouble, and when I ventured on this contrivance,
I believed I was saved.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> See <a href="#note_9">note 9</a>.</p></div>

<p>“But a few days after I had been borne
along in this fragile craft, seeing a favourable
spot to obtain a fresh supply of roots and fruit,
I attached my float to the shore, and went in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
search of them. I had not gone far before I
found myself in presence of an enormous bear
of appalling ferocity. My rifle was on the
raft, and I had only my big knife at my girdle,
and although I had heard of the artifice
practised by the Siberians in slaying this
ferocious beast, I shrank at first from exposing
myself to such a danger. I tried to flee, but
it was useless; I began climbing up a tree,
but the bear followed me everywhere. At last,
seeing no escape and no means of avoiding a
struggle, I summed up all my courage as a
last expedient, and stood facing the beast,
waiting the onslaught with a firm foot, determined
to sell my life as dearly as possible.
The formidable brute came up with a slouching
gait, and rose on his hind quarters to seize me
with his forepaws; just at this critical moment,
according to the Siberian mode of attack, I
leapt suddenly into his forepaws, as one human
being would into the enthusiastic embrace of
another and, raising instantly my right hand,
plunged my knife into his back to the right of
the backbone and to the depth of the heart.
My grim antagonist fell dead on the spot, and
with a few scratches on my shoulders I escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
“I then retraced my steps, dragging my
prey after me, and re-embarked in my craft
with a good stock of provisions. At last, I
delivered myself up at Irkutsk to the Russian
authorities, who pardoned me, as you are aware,
thinking probably I had been sufficiently
punished, and convinced, as they doubtlessly
were, of my intention to live henceforth peaceably
in this city in expectation of my ultimate
liberty.”</p>

<p>It may be seen from this touching narrative
how difficult it would be for exiles to escape.
Should even the greatest precautions and the
most ample stock of provisions allow them
to remain concealed a long time in the forests,
the abundance of snow in winter would drive
them out on to the beaten road, the only
practicable way, and consequently into the
hands of the authorities. An evasion, therefore,
similar to the one just, related to me,
should, in order to succeed, be accomplished
in three months, and that would be quite
impossible.</p>

<p>During my stay at Irkutsk, M. Silegnikof,
the governor-general, was recalled to St.
Petersburg. Several people, whose acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
I had made, left also and preceded him
on the road in order to warn the authorities
of all the villages they passed to level the
snow on the way, so as to spare this old
gentleman the fatigue of so long a journey.
When these had left, M. Bohdanovitch was
my most constant companion.</p>

<p>In Siberia, during winter, none of our
methods of cleaning the streets or removing
sewage can be employed. Refuse of every
description is collected by carts, and deposited
over the bed of the river. So long as the
frost lasts, no inconvenience is felt from this
accumulation: but, when a thaw begins, it is
quite otherwise; then the air is pervaded with
a noxious odour, and the water, for a week
afterwards, is not potable. The Siberian
towns are, therefore, very unhealthy at the
breaking up of the frost.</p>

<p>During my sojourn at Irkutsk, a quantity
of enormous birds constantly alighted on the
fetid ice of the Angara, and M. Bohdanovitch
and I went into the country, to get a shot at
them on their way to this repulsive spot, where
they were accustomed to feed.</p>

<p>Then we made excursions together in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
neighbourhood of Irkutsk, and visited some
country houses, the residences of some of the
millionaires I have mentioned, and particularly
that of M. Trapeznikof. When a district is
covered with forests and watered with three
rivers, it is easy to create charming residences.
Our French taste, with such elements, would
have worked marvels. Although the architect
of M. Trapeznikof has not made the most of
every natural advantage, it is, nevertheless,
remarkable: lakes and cascades, mounds and
slopes, are there in abundance, and these,
though fashioned by the hand of man, form
in the centre of a fine forest, a charming
seat.</p>

<p>As soon as the new governor-general, M.
Solachnikof, made his appearance, I was invited
to join him in a wolf hunt in the neighbourhood
of the Siberian capital.</p>

<p>These animals are allured, a day or two
previously, by the carcases of horses or oxen;
then, when they are well assembled at their
repast, people come in large numbers, and
gradually enclose them by forming a circle.
It was very exciting sport to bring down this
kind of game, so soon as they slipped through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the circle of hunters. I have never seen in any
menagerie wolves to be compared with these
Siberian beasts; they are of formidable height
and size. But when they are dead, it is
almost impossible to approach them, on
account of their odour and the swarm of repulsive
parasites escaping from their fur.</p>

<p>We were returning very lazily on our hunters,
that had taken us, by the road to Lake Baikal,
to the rendezvous in the forest, when a little
animal, to which my attention was directed by
one of my fellow-huntsmen calling out: “<i>A blue
fox!</i>” could be seen darting away among the
trees. “A blue fox!” they all echoed, to
warn the party of huntsmen at a little distance
behind. A shot was heard; the animal limped,
and then took its course. “Hit!” exclaimed
the governor-general, giving directions at the
same time to the Buriats, who, being equipped
with long snow skates, could run the animal
down. It was soon bagged; and the next day
I received, as a present, the carefully prepared
skin of this little quadruped, that had occasioned
more excitement than a pack of
wolves.</p>

<p>As I have already mentioned, a man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
appreciated in Russia according to the fur he
is wrapped in. The most highly esteemed is
doubtlessly the fur of the blue fox, still only
that portion of it that covers the paws. They
do not here even wear any other part of the
skin of this animal; but these furs, without
these choice bits, are exported to France and
England, to the great joy of the ladies of these
countries, who, if their husbands are disposed
to be obliging, esteem themselves very elegantly
attired in them, though in Russia, and
particularly at Irkutsk, their wearers would
be regarded by connoisseurs as eccentric and
ridiculous. And the relative value here will
show the difference of appreciation, for the
whole fur, except that of the four paws, fetches
no more than the latter; that is to say, from
two pounds fifteen shillings to three pounds
five shillings. But the difference in appreciation
in Russia is much more remarkable if it be
borne in mind that certain cloaks of blue fox,
so highly esteemed throughout this empire,
composed entirely of the fur of the paws, are
estimated at from one thousand four hundred
to one thousand six hundred pounds sterling the
cloak, the whole of which could be swallowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
up by a few moths and their progeny in the
course of a few weeks!</p>

<p>The next highly esteemed fur in importance
is the beaver; consequently very few cloaks
are seen of these skins.</p>

<p>And then comes the sable, which is frequently
employed for mantles, at least for the
cuffs and collars. These luxurious-looking
furs are lined inside sometimes with commoner
ones; I have even seen at St. Petersburg some
that were not lined at all.</p>

<p>The jenotte is in the fourth rank. This is
very much appreciated by travellers, because
it is considered elegant, though the value may
vary considerably according to the length and
thickness of the hair. I have seen jenotte
cloaks so low as ten pounds, and others estimated
at about fifty pounds. As the difference
of value cannot be appreciated at a distance,
a man is considered elegantly clad in this fur
even when the real value is very little.</p>

<p>The marten is generally placed in the fifth
rank. This is the fur of an animal quite different
from the sable, though it is frequently
erroneously designated in France as <i>martre
zibeline</i>. The fur of the sable is dark-coloured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
very thick, and a little rough to the touch; that
of the marten, on the contrary, is light yellow,
and feels like a silky down.</p>

<p>Finally, the fur the least esteemed, and
consequently the least worn by the <i>beau monde</i>,
is the Astrakan. In certain cities, such as
Moscow and Irkutsk, where the fashion is
scrupulously respected, it would be even considered
very venturesome to appear in public
clad in this fur. The Astrakan cap, especially,
is regarded with the utmost disdain; and if
certain Russians have adopted among them,
as a principle of conduct,&mdash;and I have heard it
from their own mouths,&mdash;never to stoop to
salute persons <i>on foot</i> in the streets, they would
recoil, no doubt, with repugnance from the
idea of being acquainted with any one so low
as to wear Astrakan.</p>

<p>Other furs, such as sheepskin, bear, and elk,
are used by the untitled and obscure million.
But, since they are the warmest, the rich do
not disdain to wrap themselves up in them
when travelling, thinking at the same time
to give these cloaks a more elegant appearance
by setting them off with collars of beaver,
fox or jenotte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
The extraordinary price of fur from the paws
of the blue fox is apparently no criterion of
its value in the eyes of the <i>beau monde</i>, but
rather the result of a conventional caprice of
millionaires, who find in this object a convenient
badge and mode of displaying their
riches; for none, perhaps, but the very opulent
and the prodigal, would be disposed to pay so
dearly for no other object than to shine as a
star of fashion. And this presumption appears
to be well supported by the fact that the
Russians keep this special luxury for themselves,
and very naturally, because the English
and French would not appreciate it as a sign
of wealth, and, consequently, would pay no
higher for it than the price it would command
merely as an article quite <i>à la mode</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> See <a href="#note_10">note 10</a>.</p></div>

<p>But this foible for parading riches is by no
means limited to the expedient of wearing this
exquisite fur. Pearls, for instance, have long
been a favourite medium, and this the Muscovites
seem to have derived from the Romans.
Two hundred years ago, “the Russian grandees,”
says Lord Macaulay, “came to court
dropping pearls and vermin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
There is, however, no reason to suppose that
“dropping pearls”&mdash;with or without their concomitants
at court&mdash;was a mode of parade ever
held to be <i>haut ton</i>; for a continuous dropping
of “unwinnowed” pearls would have involved
a burden as intolerable as the Muscovite chasuble.
But if this particular art of display did not
bloom into a fashion, it was at least a device
full of meaning and “movement.” For was
not an abundance of riches not only dropping,
but “running over,” suggestive of super
abundance&mdash;a sign of something <i>de trop</i>?</p>

<p>The spectator gazes in wonder, no doubt, at
the many bushels of precious pearls garnered
under glass cases at the monastery of Troïtsa;
but the spectacle after all is a mere Dutch
picture of still-life in comparison with this
nacreous shower&mdash;this <i>tableau vivant</i> at court,
as full of life and flowing riches as the golden
drops falling animated at the feet of Danae.</p>

<p>This epigram of Lord Macaulay’s is so
amusingly droll that the reader will excuse
one more digression. Pascal has said: “Si
le nez de Cléopâtre eût été plus court, toute
la face de la terre aurait changé.”</p>

<p>Now, might not the portentous difference in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the history of the world, implied in the release
of Antony, have been as readily brought about
by the Egyptian siren if, instead of dissolving
and drinking her precious pearls to detain
her lover, she had dropped them at his feet
<i>rigoureusement à la russe</i>?</p>

<p>A nose “plus court” might not have
changed in either sense “toute la <i>face</i> de
la terre,” for,</p>

<p>But as history records no precedent that
would deprive the Russian grandees of the
honour of having been the originators of the
“courtly” mode, Cleopatra obviously could
not have imitated it in all its integrity. The
Muscovite nabobs, however, like Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Gresham, might imitate Cleopatra. The rich
citizen of London, to rival the Spanish ambassador
in a magnificent dinner, is said to have
pulverized a pearl of the value of fifteen
thousand pounds, and then drunk it in a toast
to his sovereign. And these nabobs, since
they are decidedly of opinion that prodigality
is the most intelligible mode of displaying
riches, might win more applause by likewise
drinking their pearls in bumpers to their czar,
or, perhaps, in throwing away their pearls and
drinking their wine, by changing the Siberian
custom of flinging champagne on the road
before horses to actually casting their pearls
before swine.</p>

<span class="subhead">IRKUTSK TO LAKE BAIKAL.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The natives&mdash;The Olkhonese&mdash;Shamanism&mdash;The Buriats&mdash;The
Tungus&mdash;The Samoyeds&mdash;The Carnival at Irkutsk&mdash;Pablo&mdash;Adieu
to Constantine&mdash;Another perilous night on
the ice of Lake Baikal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among other races, natives of the island of
Olkhon are occasionally met with in the streets
of Irkutsk. The shores of Lake Baikal, before
the Russian conquest, had served, from the
most remote times, as a place of banishment
for the Chinese. They called this country, in
their figurative language, the land of long
nights. Some of the descendants of these
exiles still exist in these parts, and inhabit a
little island on the western shore of Lake Baikal,
called Olkhon. Many of these islanders still
adhere to the ancient Shamanic religion,
from which sprang later, they say, the widely
spread worship of Buddha. Not much is known
of this religion of Shamanism beyond the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
that they worship a supreme being, who resides
in the sun.</p>

<p>Müller, in his important work on Siberia,
refers to the superstitions of these people,
and gives some account of their ceremonies.</p>

<p>“The Shamanists,” he says, “fear especially
ghosts, and the resentments of the dead, to
whom, when alive, they had done some injury.
To charm away the evil that these may visit
on them, they leap on certain days over burning
faggots.</p>

<p>“They believe in sorcerers who predict the
future for them.</p>

<p>“On fête days, they assemble round one of
their priests, who beats on a drum and recites
prayers, whilst an acolyte sprinkles the faithful
with milk and alcohol.”</p>

<p>One of these old Olkhonese, one day, related
to me a legend, concerning the sect inhabiting
the Trans-Baikal. In order to understand
this legend, it is necessary to know that there
is a great difference of level between Irkutsk
and Lake Baikal, and that all the waters of
this lake are held in check at the highest by
an enormous rock, at the opening of the
Angara. If this rock, they say, were to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
away, all the water in the lake would rush down
in a single wave, annihilate Irkutsk and, carrying
everything before it with frightful rapidity,
would form a vast sea filling the valley
of the Angara. The Shamanists believe that
the souls of the departed are transported on
to this rock after death. The top of this
rock where they sojourn is so narrow and precipitous
that they are seized with giddiness,
and being close to the turmoil and rush of the
flood into the Angara, they are so bewildered
with it, that they can hardly keep their footing.
If they succeed in doing so, it is because
they have been good and have the grace of
God; if, on the contrary, their life has been
wicked, they are drawn in and lost in the
rushing waters. The roar produced by the
impetuosity of these waters of the Angara, is,
according to these people, nothing more than
the united lamentations of the souls who
fear losing their balance. It is true, that at
this spot, the mountains give a striking echo
from the uproar of the fall. I do not suppose
I should be suspected by my readers of
belief in the supernatural, and yet, I could
easily fancy, in this imposing concert of nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
that I was sometimes listening to human
voices from the Shamanic rock.</p>

<p>But the Buriats, a people who originate from
the neighbourhood of Nertschinsk, to the west
of Irkutsk and Lake Baikal, and the Tungus,
who pretend to be even better horsemen than
the Kirghiz or the Mongols, are the most
numerous of these divers races seen at Irkutsk.
These two races have become so Russianized
in their habits, and almost in their costumes,
that it is unnecessary to say much about them.
Neither the nose, nor the cheek-bones, nor the
forehead is prominent: one can then easily
realize to himself the appearance of the profile
of a Buriat. The women redeem the plainness
of their faces by a figure generally very fine,
and an extraordinary smoothness of skin,
which has become proverbial in Siberia. Now
and then some Samoyeds are seen, a race
formerly nomadic, but who begin, I am informed,
to people Yakutsk, just as the Buriats
and the Tungus have established themselves
at Irkutsk and around there. The clothing of
these people of the extreme north, is made of
the skin of the reindeer, ornamented with little
bits of cloth, generally of bright red. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
seen several of them clad in seal skins, and
skins of other amphibious animals: but these
it seems, are the poorest, for this kind of fur
is cheap and not warm.</p>

<div id="ip_248" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i289.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SAMOYED PEASANTS.</div></div>

<p>There is no race more degraded in the
characteristic of regarding the women as inferior
beings, and among no other, are they
treated so harshly as among the Samoyeds.
“They are annoyed and oppressed,” says
Pallas, “even in their own tents. The men
put a pole behind the fire-place, facing the
entrance, and the women are not allowed to
stride over this. This stolid, idiotic race of
beings believe that if the wife should unluckily
pass within, the night will not end without a
wolf coming and devouring one of their reindeer.
To be in a delicate state, euphemised as
‘interesting,’ is considered degrading. During
this period, women dare not eat fresh meat;
they are obliged to be satisfied with less palatable
food. They are particularly ill-treated at
the period of their <i>accouchement</i>. They are
obliged to make their confession in the presence
of the husband and the midwife: to declare
whether they have been unfaithful to their
lords, and if so, to name the paramour. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
take good care not to deny the imputation,
fearing, that in doing so, they would have to
endure cruel sufferings at the critical moment:
on the contrary, if they are guilty, they
avow their peccadillo with perfect frankness.
Their confession, however, is attended with
no inconvenience. The husband merely goes
in search of the accused, and exacts from him
some slight compensation.”</p>

<p>The revelry of the carnival at Irkutsk is
quite different from that in France: it consists
principally in continuous promenades in large
open sledges, around which are suspended
numerous bells: the harness also is covered
with bells wherever they can be attached.
But this is not sufficient; enthusiasts violently
agitate others in their hands to produce a
more effective resonance; and, by way of
accompaniment, that nothing may be missing,
children and the lower classes, who, in
ordinary times, slide rapidly on their skates
over a little wooden causeway, covered along
the houses with frost-hardened, well-beaten
snow, flit past in greater numbers at these
rejoicings, in which bells again are not wanting
to complete the stirring hurly-burly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
My windows unhappily were towards the
principal street, where this abominable jingling
was ever present. Never did I feel so much
the want of a little quietness, as during these
ten days of carnival, than which nothing better
could be contrived <i>à porter le diable en terre</i>.</p>

<p>Never did I salute with more pleasure the
arrival of Lent.</p>

<p>During the first three days of this period
of penitence, a singular custom permits the
coachmen attached to the house where you
are staying to pay you a visit and demand a
present. I, being a foreigner, was unduly
honoured in seeing defile before me, in the
rear of the drivers of the establishment, all the
<i>isvostchiks</i> or cabmen that had profited by my
fares during my sojourn.</p>

<p>In order to escape from these importunities,
I went to the convent of St. Innocent, where
I witnessed the solemn ceremonies at the
commencement of Lent.</p>

<p>During this period, the saint is the object
of the highest veneration. His tomb is not
only opened, like that of Saint Sergius, but his
body, unlike that of the patron of Troitza, is
not covered with any shroud. The body is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
wonderfully preserved, except in the colour of
the skin, which is quite black. A pious
legend informs the inhabitants of Irkutsk, that
this colour arises from the sins of the faithful,
that have quitted their souls the instant they
kissed this precious relic. I have often
witnessed the enthusiasm with which the
devotees of Eastern Siberia embrace the
venerated remains, and the contentment they
feel, in removing with their nail or a pen-knife,
a splinter of the coffin, the remainder
of which will soon in this way inevitably
disappear.</p>

<p>It may be noticed also, in many other
practices, how very sincere and profound is
the piety of the Siberian peasant.</p>

<p>I have observed, many times, with what
scrupulousness, these simple folks keep the
fasts that are prescribed. It occurred to me
sometimes, on days marked for penitence&mdash;and
there are many&mdash;on arriving at a posting
stage, to ask, from curiosity, if I might be
provided with some food. “It is Lent,
Monsieur,” they invariably replied, “We can
take nothing but tea to-day: we have no
bread even, to offer you.” It seems strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
that a Government which has known how to
employ so well a religion as a political power,
should not modify a regulation so enervating
to a poor population needing more food and
vigour.</p>

<p>Before leaving Irkutsk, I visited the museum
to see the collection of fossil mastodons,
remains that abound in certain strata in
Siberia: and now after having been hunting
with the Governor General several times, and
enjoyed myself here for six weeks, I thought
it time to resume my journey.</p>

<p>M. Pfaffius had promised to inform me,
from Kiachta, when a caravan of Russian
tea-merchants would form there, in order to
proceed to the south of China.</p>

<p>“Try to find an interpreter,” he told me,
“in order that you may never be at a loss to
understand these tea-merchants, and they will
undertake all the necessary arrangements
for your journey among the Mongols and the
Chinese.” But I had no choice to make, for
only one man presented himself to accompany
me from Irkutsk in the capacity of interpreter.
He was honest to the backbone, I admit, but
his history must have been curious. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
claimed to be a French subject, but he was
born in Constantinople, and had never seen
France. He was known by the Spanish name
of Pablo, and his passport was written in
Greek.</p>

<p>He pretended he could speak all the
languages of the Levant, Russian even, as
well as Italian and French; but to make
myself intelligible I was frequently obliged
in speaking French to interlard my phrases
copiously with Italian, Russian and even
German words. He had, however, the faculty
of making himself so well understood to
everybody, by aiding his jargon with signs,
that I considered myself very fortunate in my
acquisition. This genius of elucidating the
signification of his words by gesture, was
evidently derived from his former profession,
which was that of a player of pantomime in
a circus.</p>

<p>Although this Pablo was now in my service,
and was ready to do anything I required,
Constantine wished to help me, for the last
time, in my preparation for departure. Though
our characters were opposed in many features,
one does not separate with indifference from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
a travelling companion, who has been by your
side day and night in a journey of fifteen
hundred leagues, and especially when the
parting is to be for ever. My young fellow
traveller moved me by the uneasiness he
manifested on my intended passage over the
Lake Baikal. He begged me again and again,
for three days, not to expose myself to this
danger, but to turn the lake on the south;
and, as a proof of the interest he took in my
safety, in order to dissuade me from my
purpose, he brought to me, when I was about
to start, the chief of police, who assured me
that the Government had taken no precautions
this year for the safe passage of the lake along
the ordinary track.</p>

<p>On receiving this intimation I yielded, and,
alas! I had much cause to regret my
determination, or rather, having modified it,
as the reader will learn; for prudence, under
these circumstances, did not secure safety.
Pablo was overjoyed at my decision. His
exaggerated fear of the dangers, and his
solicitude for his personal comfort, had inspired
me from the first with uneasiness regarding
our future relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
I set out from Irkutsk on the 20th of March,
at one in the morning. Constantine came into
the sledge, between Pablo and me, and kept
me company as far as the opposite bank of
the Angara. This short trip was a kind of
<i>résumé</i> of the three months we had just passed
together, and, when we warmly pressed our
hands for the last time, we were equally deeply
moved by the parting. He had before him
the prospect of an indefinitely prolonged
sojourn at Irkutsk; and I, a turning point in
my adventures; for the phases of my journey,
without him, were about to change completely.</p>

<p>When Constantine was gone, I was not
much disposed to begin a conversation with
Pablo. I could see no utility in this man,
except the prospective one in a future still
very uncertain, and, as I then knew Russian
well enough to accomplish alone a journey in
Siberia, his presence for the moment was
anything but agreeable.</p>

<p>The country we were passing through was
very picturesque. Mountain after mountain
covered with pine trees, producing in the
dark a singular and striking effect with their
sable hue, seemed to become loftier and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
imposing on either side, as we advanced. I
was now all the better situated for a full view
of nature, being no longer cooped up in the
canopied sledge of Nijni-Novgorod. The one
I had now was entirely open.</p>

<p>At daybreak we came in sight of the Baikal.
As the constant and violent winds in these
parts sweep the snow from the surface of the
ice, the frozen surface assumes nearly everywhere
a bluish tint resembling, in some degree,
smooth water.</p>

<p>The scene was striking. Deep, deep below
our feet, reposed a bay, in the hollow between
two chains of mountains, and then, beyond,
the lake suddenly expanded, and extended
as far as the eye could reach, to the right and
left and before us, its endless ice-clad bosom.</p>

<p>“There at last is Lake Baikal!” I exclaimed
with enthusiasm at the startling spectacle.
“Monsieur,” said Pablo, jumping up from his
seat, “Has no one, indeed, then told you?
You must call it <i>the sea</i>; otherwise it will be
angry and cause some evil.”</p>

<p>This superstitious fear revealed, at once, the
character of my new companion. Ignorant
and of weak intellect, he had borrowed something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
his fear of the unknown had prompted
him to accept as a revelation of truth regarding
it from every people he had lived among, probably
with other characteristics. He had thus,
I think, acquired from the Germans and Poles,
a little melancholy, from the Turks and Arabs,
servility, and from the Russians and Siberians,
superstition; for his honesty and simplicity, I
think he was indebted to none; it was native.</p>

<p>We descended to the shore of the lake by
the south side of the mountain. The snow,
that had melted during the previous day, had
frozen again during the night, and formed at
every step a slippery surface.</p>

<p>The sledge shot first in one direction, then
in another, in a way to inspire terror, for the
route was constantly on the ridge of a precipice.
We were, indeed, sometimes so near
it, that the yemschik had his legs, now and
then, dangling over the brink of a frightful
abyss. A sharp clack of the whip, keenly felt,
once gave a sudden diversion to the direction
of the vehicle, and we were then miraculously
saved from an appalling pitch. The yemschik,
unfortunately, was over-confident, and, when
we had escaped so far, was too ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
believe that all danger was over. He had
neglected, just before our arrival at Baikal, to
give a required sudden turn to the sledge
by administering a sharp cut to the horses,
consequently, one of the skates of the sledge
passed over the edge of the road, and the
entire vehicle and its contents instantly followed;
we rolled out, Pablo and I, into a ditch
five or six feet deep and almost perpendicular,
with all our rugs and baggage huddled
together; a pretty kettle of fish. Pablo was
too terrified to speak, and probably thought
it unnecessary to remind me of the anger of
the sea, now only too evident.</p>

<p>A short time after this <i>divertissement</i>, we
arrived at a stage. The posting master dissuaded
me from continuing my journey by
land. “The road is not only longer,” he said,
“but, as you well know, dangerous also, whilst
the ice over the Baikal is extremely thick and
not likely to crack anywhere.” We followed
his advice, and trotted away over the ice.</p>

<p>Pablo was most ridiculously alarmed every
time I spoke of <i>Lake</i> Baikal, and tried to
charm away the danger by saying, “The sea!
the sea! the sea!” On the right and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
towered, over our heads, the two chains of
mountains I have just mentioned, closing in
the southern extremity of the lake, whereon
we had just entered; and before us nothing
could be seen, as far as the horizon, but interminable
ice.</p>

<p>I was completely lost in admiration of this
striking spectacle&mdash;such a one, I think, as is
unequalled in the whole world. I had seen
nowhere else in Siberia so complete an
example of the mighty, triumphant effects of
winter as this remarkable sea of ice, and in
no other part of this climate, have I seen light
assuming such magnificent warm tones. In
the evening particularly, when the crests of the
mountains were glowing in a rich rosy light,
the surface of the Baikal, then in the shadow,
reflected an intense blue, similar to that of the
Mediterranean. The tint would have led me
to fancy that I was off Nice or the coast of
Algiers, if the sledge, and especially the accompanying
noise of its gliding, had not too
forcibly recalled me to actuality. This appalling
noise, of which I have already spoken
in my first sledging experience over the Oka,
was much more disquieting there, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
from the depth of the hollow below. Here it
contributed to the wonder of this unique
scene.</p>

<p>The night was just closing in when we
arrived at the eastern extremity of the bay.
We went on land merely to dine and change
horses. When we started again on the lake
it was nine in the evening, and our yemschik,
instead of keeping a north-east course to take
us towards the Eastern coast, went due north
towards the centre of the lake.</p>

<p>Since I had already many times noticed the
deviating course of the yemschiks over frozen
water-ways, in order to avoid some pit or some
spot of doubtful solidity, I did not at first ask
any question, but turned round from time to
time, to take a view of the retreating land.
Thus occupied, it sank lower and lower in the
horizon and at last disappeared altogether
from my eyes. The aspect was now completely
changed; it seemed as if we were on
the open sea, for whichever way we turned we
could see land nowhere.</p>

<p>I must confess that, at this moment, I began
to feel ashamed a little of my boasting indifference
a few hours before. This desolate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
inhospitable tract now made me shudder, and I
seemed to be all at once inspired with a servile
respect for this terrible Siberian sea I had so
inconsiderately insulted from the shore.</p>

<p>It was so very seldom I had had occasion
to complain of my yemschik during my
journey, that I was not by any means disposed
to find fault in this instance; I was not long,
however, in perceiving he was intoxicated, and
that he had led us astray.</p>

<p>The surface was becoming gradually more
and more irregular; a few loose or superimposed
blocks were distributed here and there;
presently these became not only larger, but
more numerous. This rough broken way, in
fact, was threatening, for the further we advanced
the more our new difficulties increased,
and it was not long before we were obliged to
make our way along mountains of ice surpassing
even those of the Tom and the Angara.</p>

<p>The view of these ever-augmenting obstacles
would have been disquieting in the open day;
but now, in the depth of the night, without an
outline of land ever so shadowy to be discerned,
and in complete ignorance of our
direction, the situation was indeed alarming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
I began questioning the yemschik, from whom
I could get no intelligible answer, even with
the aid of Pablo.</p>

<p>The poor creature was besotted&mdash;paralyzed
with fear.</p>

<p>Bewildered with the utter helplessness of
our perilous situation, the idea that came
uppermost to my mind was, to ask on which
side we could the soonest gain the land.
The yemschik held out his hand towards the
west. I understood at once the fearful plight
we were in and was resolved to wait on the
spot the break of day. The driver refused to
stop at once, making light of my apprehensions,
but the matter was so serious that I was
obliged to draw my revolver and, presenting
it at his head, threatened to shoot him on the
spot if he advanced a step further.</p>

<p>It was now about one o’clock in the morning,
and I could distinguish nothing but mountains
of ice surrounding us on all sides. On examining
these hillocks, I found they were built
up with blocks of about a foot thick.</p>

<p>It was clear, therefore, that we were suspended
over the depths of the lake by a floor
of no greater thickness. Could we count on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
this even, throughout, to bear up the weight
of the laden sledge and horses?</p>

<p>Between life and death, between the air we
breathed and the bottom of the lake, there was
only one foot of ice. We were not only far
from human beings, but far from the land they
inhabited. Who, indeed, knew where we were?
Who would be thinking of us at this hour?
Who at this distance could have heard our last
desperate cry of anguish, at the moment when
the ice, breaking under our weight, would open
and then close over us for ever?</p>

<p>The mournful moaning of the wind in the
hollows of this glacial wild, interrupted by
the ominous cracking of the ice, like the low
booming of cannon in the distance, broke the
silence of the night. Never had I felt the
weakness, the ignoble insignificance of man in
a manner so complete and absolute: never had
I been so sensible to the imposing might of
Nature. I held my breath with awe, for man,
in her august presence, would be as meaningless
as a grain of sand or the poorest worm, if the
moment should come when he was doomed to
be crushed in the terrible exercise of her power.</p>

<p>When day at last appeared we could realize,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
still more forcibly, the danger of our situation.
There were fissures scoring the surface in
every direction. Pools of water in certain
spots showed that the congelation in these
parts, from some cause or other, had only been
partial. On seeing myself exposed to so many
snares, I understood why the Russian Government
had declined assuming any responsibility
this year for the safety of travellers. I was
abandoned to my own resources and trembled
for the consequences, for it seemed I was lost.</p>

<p>In the dilemma I knew not what to do; it
was necessary to move, for we could not escape
danger by remaining still any longer, and I
gave orders to the driver, mechanically, as if
spell-bound, to take his course towards the
rising sun. We started; no way could have
been more prudently selected and, in spite of
the element of danger still existing, be more
replete with thrilling interest. We were
obliged to make many long windings to avoid
some crevice or other. The yemschik, now
having recovered from the effects of his intemperance,
seemed desirous of redeeming his
fault, and went on foot alone in advance in
peril of his life, to ascertain the thickness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the ice. We were obliged to pull up now and
then, as we came near an ominous long streak
of rippling water that barred our passage.
If we ventured to brave it, we decided to
draw back on our steps a little way&mdash;<i>reculer
pour mieux sauter</i>&mdash;and then, with the whip
smartly applied, aided with wild gesture, hallooing
and screaming, to give a mad rattling
pace to the horses, we cleared, in the twinkling
of an eye, but not without a sickening horror,
these treacherous crevices gaping to devour us.</p>

<p>About eight in the morning we caught a
glimpse of the land, and soon after it plainly
came into sight. The further we advanced
the thicker and more reliable the ice became,
and every step now raised our long depressed
spirits, till, at last, all further danger disappeared.
Then, strange to say, I felt a pang of
regret to quit the Baikal: for though I had
blenched with fear, I could not forget that I
was still standing on enchanted ground.</p>

<p>At last, at ten in the morning, I entered the
village of Slernaia to reflect over the twenty-two
hours passed on Lake Baikal&mdash;the most
stirring and momentous adventure I have
experienced in all my travels.</p>

<p class="center">Observations on Eastern Siberia and its inhabitants&mdash;Their
dream of Independence&mdash;Motives that might contribute
to independence&mdash;Example of the Chinese&mdash;The Yakuts
and the inhabitants of Kamtchatka.</p></blockquote>

<p>While breakfasting the following morning at
Verchni-Oudinsk, I overheard a singular conversation
between three men, who were probably
natives of this part, for they declared
themselves to be more attached to Eastern
Siberia than to the Russian Empire; and
these reminded me of the people of Vannes
or St. Brieux, who profess to love Brittany
more than France. If the empire were in
danger or the throne of the Czar threatened,
these men would no doubt do their duty and,
perhaps, better than many others; but, for all
that, it was easy to perceive that this Eastern
portion of Siberia was by far the nearest to
their heart. “What a beautiful country!&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>How
fertile it is!” they exclaimed, “we have
not only abundance of wheat and other grain,
but what excellent wine comes from the Ussury
valley. I cannot understand at all why our
Emperor lives at St. Petersburg. You will
see; our capital, which is so unhealthy, will
be abandoned one of these days: then the
Court will come and establish itself on the
banks of the river Okhotsk.”</p>

<p>I do not think that the dream of these simple
people is worth consideration, still, at some
future period, this feeling might develop into a
longing for national independence in a manner
much more practical among these inhabitants
of the banks of the Amoor, and in this event
would not be without significance.</p>

<p>It is not very long since the country to the
north of the Amoor has been annexed to the
Russian Empire, and, as it was a complete
desert before this period, it is not surprising
that this region is still only very thinly peopled.</p>

<p>The Amoor river has a course of a thousand
leagues, and the Governor General informed
me, that on this immense territory there were,
including the military and civil service, in all
twenty-six thousand souls. But since these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
inhabitants are natives of the old Russian
Empire, and are here as colonists, it is natural
they should still remain attached to their
native country and their Emperor. In the
course of a few generations, however, the
people of the banks of the Amoor will not fail
to perceive that independence will lead to
wealth, and, with this incentive, what efforts
would they not make to obtain it?</p>

<p>In short, the corn of Siberia is very often
preferred by the inhabitants of Northern
Russia to that of Odessa. The cultivators on
the banks of the Amoor could supply not only
themselves but export grain, and profit largely
by the exportation. The valley of the Ussury,
which would produce not only wine, but all the
fruits of the South, such as oranges and
bananas, would create additional riches. The
inhabitants of this country would not then be
obliged, as they are now, to send to St. Petersburg
all the gold they get out of the earth.
They might also accumulate wealth from other
sources in their land, from the immense deposits
of iron and graphite, (for the famous
Alibert mine is in this district), from clay for
the manufacture of porcelain, the forests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
also the coal of the island of Tarakai. Moreover,
the sea of Okhotsk would furnish them
with an easy outlet, and communication with
the markets of the world, whilst the Russian
ships from St. Petersburg, could not leave the
Baltic, if opposed by Germany, Sweden, and
Denmark, or indeed even by England and
Holland.</p>

<p>It will be evident from these facts, that this
region, measuring ten or twelve hundred
leagues in length by eight or nine hundred
wide, has all the resources necessary to form
not only an independent state, but one of the
richest even in the world. It is not at all
unlikely, in the course of a few years, that the
inhabitants of this country, hitherto a little overruled
and overreached by the Czar, will open
their eyes to the tempting advantages within
their reach, and attempt to secure them fully
by making an effort to gain their independence.
It may be objected, perhaps, that the prospect
of a revolution in Russia is far too remote for
such a movement to come to pass; that the
religion is too deeply rooted in the hearts of
the people, and, consequently, they have too
much veneration for the sacred person of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Czar to venture to assail him. This is, to a
certain extent, true, and what I have related
about the sentiments of the assassins towards
the Poles, in the prison of Irkutsk, gives some
weight to the objection. Still, in Russia, it
must be admitted, that the respect for religion&mdash;contrary
to its form of manifestation in
France&mdash;diminishes in proportion as the social
rank rises. And then, if the respect for
religion vanishes, that for the authority of the
Emperor will soon follow. In Eastern Siberia,
in fact, where everyone is trying to enrich
himself and often succeeds, examples among
these of this disregard for religion, which I
have heard so frankly expressed, are not
wanting; and when this will have spread
among the multitude, the sacred authority of
the Emperor, that keeps this country in subjection,
will have lost its hold.</p>

<p>I can give instances of this irreverence, for,
while I was at Irkutsk, I happened to ask one
of the richest and most important personages
there, if the priests were gathered from the
peasantry. “Oh, no,” he replied. “Then
they belong to the upper classes?” “Not at
all.” “Then where are they recruited?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
“God knows where,” he replied, with the
utmost contempt, as if they were quite beneath
his notice.</p>

<p>Another inhabitant of Irkutsk, in a still
higher position, asked me one day, how I had
passed my Sunday. I told him that, among
other occupations, I had been in the morning,
to hear mass by the archimandrite, and in the
evening at the theatre, to hear <i>Orphée aux
Enfers</i>. “Then,” added my interlocutor, “you
have assisted, to-day, at two <i>représentations
bouffes</i>.”</p>

<p>I do not affirm that all the members of the
Russian aristocracy speak so contemptuously
of their religion and their priests: but here,
certainly, are two remarks that no Catholic
in our country even, without faith and without
any apparent respect whatever for religion
or authority, would have dared to make.</p>

<p>There is not in Siberia as in European
Russia so great a distance between the people
and the upper classes. The peasantry, one
day, will not fail to notice the manner in
which their creed, to which they have always
bent the knee in veneration, is treated by their
superiors, and will not be slow in claiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the alluring liberty they have discovered in
those who should serve as models for their
conduct.</p>

<p>It may be objected again, that this patient
and submissive character of the Russian people,
and the remoteness of the Eastern Siberians
from any civilized nation that might set them
an example and encourage them, would retard
this emancipation.</p>

<p>The Russians, it is true, are so habituated to
a state of patient endurance, in which they
live; their resignation is so manifested in their
conduct, in their forms of politeness bordering
on servility, in their music, and even in their
amusements, that it seems impossible there
should be a great leader forthcoming from
among them capable of changing their destiny.
Their neighbours, the Chinese, live under a
form of Government, perhaps, still less desirable,
and, consequently, these two nations
seem incapable of ever escaping from the
slavery under which they now live.</p>

<div id="ip_272" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i315.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">JOURNEY OVER LAKE BAIKAL.</div></div>

<p>But the Chinese, it must be admitted, are
far from accepting their subjection with as
much resignation as their neighbours of the
North. Hitherto accustomed to regard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
frontiers of their empire as the limits of the
world, and ignorant of the means by which
liberty is acquired, it is not surprising that
they should have submitted to an authority
imposed on them from the first by irresistible
force. But to change their views completely,
they require only to know us, and then this
enlightenment will gradually spread among
them. They are not indeed very partial to
us, but we astonish them, and they study us.
They will soon appreciate the difference of
condition between the European nations and
the people of the Celestial Empire: they will
come among us to educate themselves still
more; and since the Chinese are naturally
intelligent and logical, doing nothing superficially,
they will adopt among themselves such
of our institutions as appear to them sound,
and adapted to secure the prosperity and happiness
of a nation.</p>

<p>In this event the example would probably be
followed in rich, but unhappy Siberia.</p>

<p>The three men I have mentioned, taking
their meal at Verchni-Oudinsk, and who
seemed so convinced of the brilliant future
of Eastern Siberia, were not long in entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
into conversation with us. Pablo availed
himself of the opportunity for expatiating on
the terrors he had experienced on Lake
Baikal. He described them with much emphasis,
not forgetting the most trifling incident,
and embellished his narrative with a recital
of certain feats of personal prowess that had
inevitably escaped my observation. I should
certainly have cut short so bombastic and
prolonged an entertainment, if I had not seen
this man take from my store of provisions a
bottle of brandy which I had kept for a
different object, deliberately fill his glass and
then his companions’, and calmly continue his
diversion, sipping all the time as if he were
taking his <i>kirsch</i> or <i>anisette</i>.</p>

<p>I wondered at this habit of swallowing thus
such strong spirit. It was probably the cold of
Siberia that induced the habit, for he was not
addicted to it at Constantinople. This droll
fellow, in gratifying this singular taste, revealed
a superstition still more odd. He took a pinch
of earth from a kind of snuff-box he kept
constantly in his pocket, and throwing it into
his brandy, gulped it, as if it had been deliciously
sweetened with so much sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
When I asked him the reason for this
practice, he explained: “This earth has been
taken from my native land. If I swallow a
morsel of it in this way, from time to time,
I am sure of not catching any epidemic disease
in the country where I am travelling. If you
had known that, before quitting France, you
would not have been ill on your arrival at
Irkutsk.”</p>

<p>Pablo, it may be seen, was a singular
creature. Good nature and devotedness were
so conspicuous in him, that I congratulated
myself on having brought him with me: but
I should never come to the end if I were to
relate all the eccentricities of this half-cracked,
childish, superstitious specimen of human
nature.</p>

<p>Before leaving Verchni-Oudinsk and entering
on Chinese territory, I ought to say a few
words about a few tribes inhabiting Eastern
Siberia, many specimens of which I had the
opportunity of seeing before quitting this part
of the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>The Yakuts are copper-coloured and have
long black hair. Their wives are regarded with
contempt. They are invariably covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
ornaments, generally of iron, yet artistically
worked. The Yakuts are good-natured,
honest, and hospitable. Their religious belief
is exaggerated to superstition and idolatry.
Their priests, in fact, are sorcerers who
exercise great influence over this simple
people by their practice of magic.</p>

<p>When Müller was here, he desired to see a
priestess who, he was informed by the
Yakuts, plunged a knife into her body without
causing death. The first time, it seems, the
operation did not succeed, but the next day,
the attempt was renewed, and this time the
blow was better directed. She had really
plunged the blade into the intestines, and
withdrew it covered with blood! “I examined
the wound,” says Müller, “I saw her
take a morsel of flesh, which she cut from
the incision and, then grilling it on the fire,
eat it. She afterwards dressed the wound with
a plaster of larch resin and birch bark, and
bound it over with a rag. But there was an
incident still more singular. She was compelled
to sign a sort of official report, in
which she declared she had never plunged
the knife into her body before having operated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
before us; that she did not even intend, at
first, to go so far; that she designed merely
to deceive us as well as the Yakuts, in dexterously
slipping the knife between her skin
and her dress; that the Yakuts had never
suspected the truth of the spell, but we had
watched her too closely; that, besides, she
had heard from other sorcerers, when one
would strike effectively he did not die after
it however little he tasted of his own fat;
and that, now being required of her own
free will to tell the truth, she could not deny
that, until now, she had deceived the Yakuts.
The wound, which she dressed twice only,
was quite cured in ten days, and, probably,
her youth contributed much to this prompt
cure.”</p>

<p>The city of Yakutsk, in the centre of the
territory inhabited by the Yakuts, is considered
to be the coldest city in Siberia.
It serves as a place of exile. I have frequently
heard of a poor poet, who was condemned
to live indefinitely in this city, after two years
of preliminary imprisonment, for having
written a little book unfavourable to the
Russian Government, which to me seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
quite harmless. This book is entitled <i>Sto.
délaïti</i>, “What is to be done”?<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> See <a href="#note_11">Note 11</a>.</p></div>

<p>The inhabitants of Kamtchatka are divided
into three peoples, whose language and manners
are dissimilar. The Koriaks in the
north, the Kamtchatdales in the centre, and
the Kuriles in the south.</p>

<p>Among the Koriaks,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> some are nomadic,
others stationary.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Krachenninikov.</p></div>

<p>The wandering Koriaks have Arab features,
and small eyes, shaded with thick eye-brows;
they are not so stout nor so tall as the
stationary Koriaks; they are also less robust
and courageous.</p>

<p>And yet, the nomads despise the sedentary
tribe as slaves, and these quietly accept this
servility. When a wandering Koriak presents
himself to a sedentary one, the latter cringes to
him, loads him with presents, and pockets all
the disdain and insult hurled at him by his
guest, without a word of reproach.</p>

<p>The nomads are very jealous of their wives.
They slay them at once when caught in
adultery, and sometimes even on a bare suspicion
of infidelity. They take offence at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
everything. Their wives must appear sluttish
and begrimed, for fear of irritating their husbands
with too many luring charms. They
never wash nor comb themselves; they never
have any colour on their cheeks. “Why should
they varnish themselves?” their husbands ask,
“unless they want to please others.” They
therefore, sometimes, hide really good clothing
under a bundle of rags.</p>

<p>The manners of the fixed Koriaks are quite
different. They receive strangers, in the way
mentioned of the Laplanders by Bernardin de
Saint-Pierre, and they would kill a guest who
would refuse to take his place in the conjugal
bed.</p>

<p>The Koriaks, whether vagrant or stationary,
like all the inhabitants of Kamtchatka, have
no religion. “A chief of these tribes,” says
Krachenninikov, “with whom I had an opportunity
of conversing, had no idea of the
Divinity.” The Koriaks, however, fear an
evil spirit, and sometimes sacrifice to him a
reindeer, but without the object of satisfying
themselves whether this sacrifice should bring
them good or evil.</p>

<p>Could the name of worship be given to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
superstitious custom, very prevalent among
the stationary Koriaks, which consists in
giving a place in the conjugal bed to stones
swathed in clothing? “An inhabitant of
Oukinka had two of these stones; a large one,
which he called his wife, and a little one, which
was his son. I asked him,” said Krachenninikov,
“the reason of this strange act. He
told me that, one day, when his body was
covered with an eruption, he had found his great
stone on the bank of a river; as he desired to
take it, it blew on him like a human being, and,
through fear, he cast it into the river. From
this moment his malady got worse until the
end of a year, when, having gone to search for
the stone at the place he had thrown it, he was
astonished to see it again at some distance
from the spot, lying on a great flat stone with
a little one beside it. He took them both,
carried them to his dwelling, dressed them, and
soon after his malady disappeared. Since
that time, he said, I have always carried the
little stone with me, and I love my stone wife
more than my living one.”</p>

<p>This story of Krachenninikov shows to what
extent of folly, the need of a belief in a Divinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
may drive a man whose mind is neither enlightened
nor directed.</p>

<p>The Kamtchatdales have dark skins, broad
and flat faces and squat noses.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> They have a
fishy odour; they exhale also a strong scent
of sea birds, and sometimes of musk, caused by
their eating of the animal containing it without
preparation.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Abbé Chappe.</p></div>

<p>They live, however, principally on fish,
which they cook in diverse ways. The most
common consists in cutting several salmon in
six parts. They put the heads into a pit to
decompose, dry the back and belly with smoke,
and the tail and flanks in the air. They then
pound the whole together, and afterwards dry
this paste, which serves them almost daily
for their food. Ducks and geese and eggs
preserved in fish fat form also, it is said, a
portion of their subsistence.</p>

<p>These people formerly had no other drink
than water; and to make themselves a little
lively, they used to drink an infusion of mushrooms.
Since the Russian conquest they
have become acquainted with brandy, and now
imbibe a large quantity of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
The Kamtchatdales have a great passion for
dress. The costume of a rich man was
formerly made of the skins of the reindeer, the
fox, the dog, the marmot, the wild ram, bears’
and wolves’ feet, many seals and feathers. It
required twenty animals, at least, to clothe a
Kamtchatdale. Commerce was carried on
exclusively by barter. A complete costume
was worth about a hundred martens or a
hundred foxes.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Müller.</p></div>

<p>But now this singular people have borrowed
from the Russians the taste for the clothing
material of civilized life, and in a slight degree
for the form also. The women have odd
whims; they stain their faces with red and
white. They are very particular in not showing
themselves to a stranger before having
undergone a special ablution, and then having
been well reddened and tricked out.</p>

<p>In order to obtain fire they use the fire drill,
and it is produced by twirling rapidly between
the hands a round dry stick passed through a
hole in a plank. A bit of bruised dry grass
serves as tinder.</p>

<p>The manners of the Kamtchatdales are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
very gross, that they resemble the instincts of
animals rather than the habits of man. They
have no idea of the spirituality of the soul.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
Moreover, they have no religion. A single
<i>fête</i>, called Purifications, fully described by
Krachenninikov, consists so much more in
dancing and revelling than in prayers and
sacrifices, that it would be evidently wrong,
I think, to consider it as forming part of any
religious system.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Steller.</p></div>

<p>The Kuriles inhabit the islands of the same
name which stretch, one after the other,
between the extremity of Kamtchatka and
Japan. These people feel the influence of the
civilized nation so near them; still they
approach much nearer the inhabitants of
Kamtchatka than those of Japan. They dwell
in tents, like their neighbours on the north,
and live on fish.</p>

<p>The Kamtchatdales and the Kuriles differ,
however, on many points. A Kurile wife,
when unfaithful to her husband, dishonours
him. He then challenges his adversary, and
they have a duel with clubs. He who
challenges is the first to receive, on his back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
three blows with a club of the thickness of a
man’s arm. And then he returns as many to
his enemy; the combat continues in this way,
till one of them demands pardon or succumbs
to the number and violence of the blows.</p>

<p>The Kurile mothers have a very cruel practice.
When they have two infants at a birth,
they kill one; and yet these people are gentle
and humane. They respect old age, they are
attached to their kindred, and form friendships.</p>

<span class="subhead">KIACHTA TO MAIMATCHIN.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The tarantass&mdash;Tea merchants&mdash;Their competition&mdash;The
Sienzy&mdash;Aspect of Maimatchin&mdash;A dinner at the Chinese
Governor’s&mdash;Preparations for crossing the Gobi desert.</p></blockquote>

<p>We found quite a change in the state of the
road after leaving Verchni-Oudinsk. The
sledge, in the course of a few hours, being no
longer supported with a smooth thick layer of
snow, its skates occasionally came in contact
with the earth below, and this increasing the
friction, considerably retarded our progress.
This at last produced so much jolting that,
on arriving at the first stage, we were obliged
to abandon our sledge and proceed in a
<i>tarantass</i>. This vehicle, in which the Russians
travel in summer, has no other spring than
that afforded by four birch poles resting on
the axles of four wheels. I do not know any
kind of locomotion, excepting the Chinese
mule palanquin, more uncomfortable than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
tarantass, and yet, the jolting apart, I was
delighted the first time I found myself mounted
on this vehicle. The country was still for the
most part covered with snow, but here and
there I caught a glimpse of uncovered spots:
the land that had been lost to sight since
quitting St. Petersburg, the land of Siberia,
in fact, which, although I had passed over
fifteen hundred leagues of this country, strictly
speaking, I had not yet seen. Here it was
a rich soil apparently favourable to agriculture,
but of so dark a colour that it must give
a more gloomy aspect to the neighbourhood of
the villages in summer, than the spotless
snowy shroud in winter.</p>

<p>As we went on our way, we noticed a great
difference in the people; they were more
singular-looking and of a type more Oriental:
the villagers, the yemschiks, and even the
posting masters, were nearly all Buriats. We
now often passed Chinese, in carriages or
palanquins, clad in silks, red, blue, and in fact
of every colour; still more frequently Mongols
perched on camels, or mounted on frisky little
horses, all of them capped alike with a yellow
turban lined with fur, and wrapped in a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
cloak, made of the skin of the white deer of
the Gobi desert, folded across the chest. At
last, on the 27th of March, at nine in the
morning, I caught sight, from the top of a hill,
of the village of Kiachta, at the end of which
stood up two enormous yellow posts that
marked the frontier of the Celestial Empire,
and the entry into the town of Maimatchin.</p>

<p>I went straight to M. Pfaffius. “I had no
idea,” he said, “you would have been so long
in coming from Irkutsk.” I related to him
my adventures of the Baikal. “The little
caravan of tea-merchants which you were to
join, left here yesterday morning. But you
will lose nothing by it, for there will be another
caravan leaving here in a week. You will
then have plenty of time to make all your
preparations to accompany it to Pekin, and we
shall have the pleasure of your company here
all the week.” I went to announce this news
to Ivan Michäelovitch Nemptchinof, who was
so highly delighted, and offered me, with so
much courtesy, the hospitality of his father’s
house, that I shall never forget the occasion.</p>

<p>Ivan Michäelovitch’s father,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> with whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
lodged at Kiachta, is a cousin of the Nemptchinof
I have already mentioned as one of the
three proprietors of the richest gold mine of
Trans-Baikalia. Not feeling disposed to risk
his fortune in gold-hunting, so often precarious,
he preferred devoting himself to the
tea business, and has acquired in it an immense
fortune.</p>

<p>The flourishing state of the tea trade by
caravan is due to two causes: first, the great
consumption of tea in Siberia and Russia, and
particularly in Russia, where it is the necessary
part of their meals: secondly, to its free entry
into Eastern Siberia, which the Czar has
accorded to his Eastern subjects. Since the
customs’ duty is considerable on the tea imported
by Odessa, it follows that nearly all the
tea that is drunk in Russia passes through the
hands of the Kiachta merchants, and not without
leaving in them a great many roubles.</p>

<p>These merchants are a little frightened,
just now, by the appearance of a competition,
the success of which, still doubtful, it is true,
would ruin them completely. This rival
enterprise would have for its object the
conveyance of tea by sea, from the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
of the Yang-Se’ to the port of Vladivostok,
and thence to Irkutsk, by the Ussuri and
the Amoor rivers. If this communication were
established, there is no doubt that tea could
be sold very much cheaper than at present,
for the overland carriage, through Mongolia
and the Desert of Gobi, is very expensive;
but the undertakers of the new project would
be obliged to make so considerable an outlay
from the commencement, that it is feared the
failure of it would be decisive before a single
chest could find its way by this route to
Irkutsk.</p>

<p>In order to render the carriage as low as
possible, they would propose to embark the
tea at Han-Kow, the great centre of the plantations
of South China, on the banks of the
Yang-Se’, and disembark it only at Nertchinsk
on the Schilka, immediately within the
government of Irkutsk. But to attain this
object, it would be necessary to scoop out
a canal, between Vladivostok and Lake Hinka,
where the Ussuri takes its source, a very
mountainous region; and besides, to construct
steamers small enough to pass into a canal,
and, at the same time, large enough to resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the waves, often formidable, in the China
seas. The idea is certainly ingenious and even
remarkable; but if the capital of the new company
is important enough for the establishment
of this maritime route, its success is not doubtful.
In any case, the rivalry is interesting,
and I daresay that some of my readers, already
informed of this gigantic commercial enterprise,
will be curious to learn its results.</p>

<p>The Chinese who inhabit Maimatchin were
not slow in ascertaining if Monsieur Nemptchinof
had a <i>Sienzy</i> really lodging in his
house, that is a man from the extreme west.
As specimens of this race are rather rare in
Northern China, and the curiosity of no women
in the world can approach to that of Chinese
men, all the inhabitants of Maimatchin wanted
to see me.</p>

<p>According to the Russian custom, all the
crannies of the window frames where I was were
puttied, although the cold had almost taken
its departure, but the doors were wide open; I
could not, therefore, escape from the endless
crowd of visitors, that came to see me. There
were, at least, forty or fifty at a time, in the
three little rooms that formed my suite. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
scrutinized my most ordinary gestures and
movements, pounced on all my writings, felt
my beard, which appeared to them as something
monstrous; for they are not accustomed
to see, on their own faces, nor generally even
on those of the Siberians, anything but moustaches;
and then they wanted to hear me
speak my language. Getting repeatedly quite
exhausted from their persistent and indiscreet
persecution, I remonstrated sharply, and
finding this ineffective, I lost all patience and
swore at them like a trooper; but it was all
to no purpose, for their ears were evidently so
pleased with these euphonious expressions
that they often begged me to repeat them
to the new comers that nothing might be lost.</p>

<p>The Governor could not resist the temptation
to flow with the stream. His visit
interested me. He was clad in a robe of
cloth of gold. His cap was surmounted with
a blue ball, the mark of his dignity. Two
long peacock feathers hung from the back of
this cap. This Governor was accompanied
by two Chinese officers and a Mongolian
prince. The latter was costumed like all other
Mongols; except that his chest was completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
covered with a profusion of ornaments
and amulets in silver and coral. A cousin
of Ivan Michäelovitch, M. Solomanof, acted
as interpreter. “I ought legally to oppose
your entry into China,” said the Governor
to me; “the Russians only have a right to
enter by land into the Celestial Empire. I
shall, however, wink at it. Ask M. Pfaffius
merely for a tea merchant’s passport, as a
Russian subject, in case you should have any
difficulties with the Chinese authorities you
may meet on your way.” The interview
ended by his inviting me to dine with him
the next day; an invitation I accepted with
pleasure, and we parted cordially like old
acquaintances.</p>

<p>Maimatchin is the most singular city in
the world, inasmuch as it is peopled with men
only. The Chinese women are not only forbidden
to leave their territory, but even to
pass the great wall of Kalkann and enter into
Mongolia. This rule will hinder, for some
time to come, any modification of the Chinese
character. However numerous the emigrations
may be, foreign influence will never be very
great over men born in Chinese territory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
educated there till manhood in all the customs
and prejudices of their own over-extolled
country. All the Chinese of this border city
are exclusively traders, and they accumulate
money, till their trading with Europe through
Siberia has created a sufficient fortune, to
enable them to return to their native cities
and live there in ease with their families.
Their dwellings indicate their prosperity.
They are separated from the streets by a clay
wall, rather ugly, it is true, but surrounding,
generally, a very elegant-looking house, before
which are gambolling those sleek, plump-looking
curs with unusually big eyes, such
as are pretty faithfully represented on Chinese
vases and screens. It very often happens that
objects thus represented to us, which we regard
as grotesque caricatures, are, in fact, with
their faults of perspective, rather than of form,
true images of objects of the country.</p>

<p>The main part of the houses of Maimatchin
is divided into two compartments, and that
which is behind is raised. Fires are kept up
under this great platform, which is covered
with mats, that serve as seats by day and beds
by night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Opposite the door a niche is generally seen,
where the domestic idols, unaccustomed to
attitudinize to profane eyes, repose behind an
ornamented blind.</p>

<p>The walls of the reception room are lacquered
in red or black, or sometimes, even covered
with figured silk, according to the taste and
wealth of the proprietor. The apartment
overlooking the court, is generally of light
wood, perforated and carved, and over these
openings coloured paper is stretched. The
light, sifted through the artistically carved
wood-work, and then casting its diverse
shadows on the coloured transparency, produces
something of the graceful effect of
stained glass.</p>

<p>I was deeply interested with the novelties
of these gay interiors, as might be supposed,
and I passed here many hours, called, first to
one apartment, then to another, to partake of
the liberal and courteous entertainment,
abounding in pastry and preserved fruits.</p>

<p>It is quite a misconception we have in
Europe generally, to confound the edifices
designed for worship with the high towers
usually dominating the villages. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
towers have nothing of a religious character:
they are simply landmarks in the vast plains
of Central China. They are, therefore, not
seen in mountainous districts, as in the
neighbourhood of Maimatchin for example.</p>

<p>The idol temple of this city is beside the
Governor’s house. It is approached by three
successive courts, surrounded with sunk
wooden galleries, painted in various colours.</p>

<p>In the first, rise three little structures,
covering a gigantic <i>tam-tam</i>, and two gilt
monsters. In the second, stands a theatre,
so disposed, that the doors of the temple being
open, the idol may contemplate the spectacle,
which, to me, seems to constitute an essential
part of the religious ceremony. The third
court is covered, and serves as a vestibule
to the temple specially so called, containing
idols of the most grotesque character. The
door of this temple is charming: it is of
carved open wood-work, richly gilt. There are
three sanctuaries: the centre one is devoted
to a gigantic idol with monstrous features.
I remarked the ferocious look of this figure:
he had fierce eyes; his beard, composed of
natural hair, descended to the waist, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
was robed in yellow silk. Twelve statues in
the attitude of prayer were bending before
him. A mass of ornaments, of all kinds,
encumbered this sanctuary: immense chandeliers
of wrought iron, swords, gilt lances,
lighted tapers and lanterns. The god, on
the left of this one, was conspicuous with his
three eyes and scarlet robe: it is this one that
penetrates the most secret thoughts. For
this reason, no taper was lighted before him,
his clear-sightedness requiring no adventitious
aid. The god on the right was decked in a
green robe.</p>

<p>I took care not to neglect the invitation
the Chinese Governor had given me. At
the appointed hour, I punctually presented
myself: I met there several I was acquainted
with, and, among them, my old travelling
companions living at Kiachta, whom my host
had the good taste to bring together here.
We took our places on the estrade I have
mentioned, squatting in groups of three or
four round several low tables.</p>

<p>The cover for each guest consisted of a
little plate, a liliputian cup, and two sticks.
The little plate is not intended to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
portion of any dish offered to the guest: it
contains merely some hot, black vinegar, an
indispensable sauce, incessantly renewed by
the servants, and into which one steeps each
mouthful that he has directly taken from the
dish between his two sticks.</p>

<p>When the mouthful thus seasoned is disposed
of, the two little sticks are at liberty
to seize right and left, on their points, some
savoury <i>hors-d’œuvre</i>, placed in saucers around
the central plate. They consist principally of
marine plants,&mdash;black mushrooms cultivated on
the birch-trees, scented herbs, preserved eggs&mdash;the
albumen of which, by some process, has
turned black&mdash;and little reptiles artistically
cut into spiral forms and otherwise metamorphosed.</p>

<p>I remember, on another occasion, when
I was much nearer to the sea, that one of
these side dishes was a little bowl of shrimps,
served up in some ingenious sauce that
seasoned them well without killing them: they
are eaten in this way all alive, preference being
given to those that afford the best proofs of
their liveliness by their repugnance to the
sauce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
The only drink, served in cups about the
size of thimbles, is hot rice brandy.</p>

<p>All these minute portions and preparations,
these graceful tiny utensils, this variety of little
dishes, are suggestive of a dinner children give
to their dolls. It is a table indeed, that well
represents this effeminate race of attenuated
hands and pinched feet, a race of feeble
appetites and feeble powers, that accomplishes
nothing great, unless through a slow accumulation
of puny efforts and petty means. The
mouthfuls are prepared and cut before being
served in the dishes, and each morsel is surmounted
with a red almond, to indicate that
no one has yet touched it.</p>

<p>The procession of twenty-five or thirty
dishes, composing the governor of Maimatchin’s
dinner, commenced, according to
Chinese habits, with the meats, continued with
the soups and sweets, and ended with a plate
of plain boiled rice, which is invariably
presented to the guests at the end of the
repast, no one, however, touching it, and
apparently having no other meaning than this:
“I have now offered you everything I have in
my house, and, to continue the hospitality, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
have no other resource than to place before
you the most ordinary article of diet.”</p>

<p>The day for the departure of the caravan
was now approaching, and I began to busy
myself with my preparations for crossing the
Desert of Gobi.</p>

<p>The tea merchants, with whom I was to
travel through Mongolia and north China,
undertook to furnish us with conveyances, and
to arrange with a Mongolian guide to take us
as far as the Great Wall.</p>

<p>This journey is undertaken in little Chinese
vehicles, kinds of boxes resting on a pair of
wheels behind, and supported in front by a
draught camel between two long shafts; the
box being of sufficient size to permit the occupant
to lie down. The vehicle can contain but
one traveller; and the camel, which has to bear
considerable fatigue&mdash;as the reader will subsequently
learn&mdash;cannot ascend any hill. These
animals, therefore, are not employed in the
first part of the route in Mongolia, between
Kiachta and Urga, because it is necessary to
traverse a steep road along a chain of mountains.
During this first period, these little
vehicles are drawn by oxen. The tedious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
slowness of their movements, and, besides, the
desire I had to precede the caravan to Urga,
that I might stay there a little while, induced
me not to join my companions from Kiachta,
but to proceed as far as Urga in a tarantass.
I accordingly left Pablo and my baggage to
come by the slow caravan, and I offered a
place in my Russian vehicle to M. Marine,
one of the tea merchants who was to cross,
with me, the Desert of Gobi.</p>

<p>It is astonishing what a heap of objects are
necessary when the traveller is going to
wander, more than a month, in the desert, far
from the aid of his fellow-creatures. He has
to think, not only of the necessary provisions,
but of an assortment of tools for repairing the
vehicles; preventives and remedies for man
and beast against possible accidents of the
way; presents, indispensable to making friends
among the wandering tribes; and, especially,
the strange money current among the
Mongols, a stock of which is requisite.</p>

<p>These Orientals despise gold and silver,
and their business is carried on exclusively
by barter. A tea of ordinary quality, called
<i>brick tea</i>, on account of the form given to it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
compression, is the article of food the most
appreciated, and the most common substitute
for money. One of these bricks would represent
about eight or ten shillings.</p>

<p>Needles ready threaded, sugar and brandy,
have also an important exchangeable value.
I was obliged to furnish myself with many
objects at a village neighbouring to Kiachta,
at Triosky-Sawsk, where I had an opportunity
of visiting the rare collections of M. Popoff.</p>

<p>This <i>savant</i> has studied the habits of all the
insects of Trans-Baikalia. I noticed, among
the lepidoptera, a butterfly of an extremely
rare kind, which he calls <i>Liparis Ochropoda</i>,
and which lays productive eggs without the
aid of the male. This fact is attested by some
very curious experiments, confirmed by him
by repetition, at the gymnasium of Irkutsk, and
at Triosky-Sawsk, with complete success. He
has seen these produced for three generations
successively without access to the male, the last
of these being composed entirely of males.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> See <a href="#note_13">note 13</a>.</p></div>

<p>Our tarantass, containing M. Marine and
myself, left Kiachta three days after the
departure of the caravan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
We calculated not only on joining it at
Urga, but on passing it on the way, and on
remaining many days in this city, waiting its
arrival.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, Miss Campbell, and Ivan
Michäelovich, each in a separate carriage,
kept me company on the road for about twelve
miles. We passed through Maimatchin and
entered into Mongolia. There appeared to
me very little difference between this country
and the desert. Here and there, however, but
at long distances apart, might be seen a native
encampment, composed of one or two tents
fenced around, with a camel, a horse, and a
few sheep in the enclosure.</p>

<p>As soon as the day began to close in, the
three little carriages accompanying my
tarantass pulled up, their occupants being now
obliged to return. I am ashamed to say, I had
quite forgotten to bring with me, in accordance
with the Siberian custom, a stock of champagne,
to lay the dust before their steps on
parting: I was therefore quite disconsolate.
Moreover, the changed aspect of the country,
the prospect before me of having no companion
who could speak French&mdash;for M. Marine did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
not know a word of our language&mdash;the beginning
of an existence quite new and unknown
to me, added not a little to the emotion and
sadness of such a separation.</p>

<p>After the most cordial leave-taking, I continued
my journey towards the south, whilst
my three friends, fearing that night would
overtake them on the road, set off for Kiachta
at a full gallop.</p>

<p>A cloud of fine dust of the desert was thrown
up by the horses’ feet, which speedily veiled
them from my sight.</p>

<p>My journey through Siberia, and with it one
of its most pleasing incidents, had come to an
end.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAIMATCHIN TO URGA.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">First Stage in Mongolia&mdash;The Mongols&mdash;Their tents; their
life&mdash;How they steer their way in the desert&mdash;The Caravan&mdash;A
Sacrilege&mdash;The Russian Consul at Urga&mdash;The Koutoukta.</p></blockquote>

<p>We felt the cold becoming rather cutting at
the fall of night, and we observed the thermometer
already several degrees below zero.
We therefore resolved to alight at a Mongolian
encampment, that we might be able to warm
ourselves at the family fire. Besides, M.
Marine, like a true Russian, was longing for
a cup of tea, and all the utensils necessary for
this purpose were with the caravan, far
beyond our reach. The tents, near which our
yemschik pulled up his troïka, were most
picturesquely pitched on the slope of a hill
just on the skirts of a little pine wood, and
these trees were the last I had the pleasure of
regarding for a long time. The night was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
beautifully clear, and little plots of snow, that
had stood out against the thaw of the preceding
days, were quite luminous in the silvery rays
of the moon. We quickly leapt to the ground
and then over the barrier of the paling, and
M. Marine and I, without calling out, presented
ourselves at the opening of the tent which
appeared to be the principal habitation.</p>

<div id="ip_305" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i349.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A STREET IN URGA.</div></div>

<p>These tents are firmly raised on wooden
lattice-work, covered with several layers of
sheep’s skins. They are about three yards
in diameter, and are entered by a single,
narrow, low opening, which is closed by a
sheep’s skin hanging before it. Facing
this entrance may invariably be seen a
little statuette or picture, representing the
protecting deity of the family, and, before it,
stand seven or eight small vessels or vases,
containing bread, salt, bits of wood, camel-dung,
tea,&mdash;everything in fact necessary to the
ignoble, barbaric existence of these poor, rude
people.</p>

<p>The tent was occupied by two men and a
woman, who were lying around a fire placed
in the centre, and which barely lighted with
its glowing embers this wretched hovel. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
soon discovered that this recumbent attitude
was the only one supportable; for the abundance
of smoke rendered respiration impossible
beyond two or three feet above the ground.
This is the reason the Mongols appear nearly
black, from having their faces covered with
a layer of soot, a coating they are not accustomed
to remove. The wife, like all Mongolian
women, was covered with jewels. A demi-crown
in silver was set on her forehead; two
large pins gathered her hair behind her ears,
as in Egyptian mummies, and two enormous
brooches, also of silver, fastened the ends of it
over her chest; the whole being ornamented
with variously coloured stones.</p>

<p>These three human beings crouching like
tired hounds around a smouldering heap of
dried camel-dung, whose feeble and fitful
glowing alone lighted up in the gloaming
their black eyes and glittering jewels, formed
a scene, in which the startled imagination
conjured up, from mediæval times, midnight
councils of black spirits, looming through “the
fog and filthy air.” It was one altogether
spectral and diabolic. A few hours had indeed
transformed my existence, and carried me beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
the pale of civilized life into a desert,
where I was doomed to pass many long days
and nights, in which there was no retreat but
these unearthly abodes. But then, on the
other hand, I was well provided with food and
utensils; and, as I looked up through an opening
in the top of the tent, and gazed on the
pale twinkling stars, they seemed to invite me
benignly to spread my repast on the desert
sand and trust to their unerring guidance over
the trackless way.</p>

<p>Our yemschik was not long in following us
into the tent: as he was a Buriat, he entered
into conversation with our hosts, who seemed
pleased to receive us. I tried to make myself
intelligible to M. Marine, but did not venture
to do so in Russian: the ease, however, with
which I made myself understood, gave me a
high opinion of his intelligence. The Mongols
quickly perceived that signs and gestures
were important elements in our conversation,
and I was to them, as to the Chinese of
Maimatchin, an object of much curiosity. I
took care, however, to keep them at a respectful
distance, and not to allow myself to be touched
by any member of this filthy, fulsome, fetid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
race, teeming with vermin and covered with
corroding sores. There is not, I am sure,
any people in the world more disgusting than
the Mongols. Water in this region, unhappily,
is too precious to admit of its use for any
other purpose than drinking. These wretched
creatures are therefore putrefying in their
wounds: sometimes, in fact, their limbs drop
off and they perish piecemeal, inspiring with
horror all those who come near them, who can
only stand helpless and aghast at such a
spectacle of human suffering.</p>

<p>When we had refreshed ourselves and
warmed our benumbed limbs, we hastened to
emerge from this loathsome hut and to
breathe again, under the star-bespangled
firmament, the pure bracing desert air.
Then we stretched ourselves in our tarantass
for our night’s repose.</p>

<p>It was about three o’clock in the morning,
when our horses had sufficiently rested, and
we resumed our way.</p>

<p>During this journey we found ourselves,
many times, suddenly surrounded by Mongol
horsemen clad in yellow jackets and red
breeches, who, having spied a Russian conveyance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
had galloped up at full speed to
gratify their curiosity. They had long poles
rather heavy fastened to their horses and
trailing behind them, and these left on the
sand a trace of their course.</p>

<p>This precious furrow, playing the part of the
little white pebbles of Tom Thumb, prevents
them from going astray, and brings them,
after many days’ wild roving over the desert,
unerringly back to their tents. Armed so
formidably as they appeared to be, sometimes
with a bow and arrows, sometimes with a
musket bristling with a spike, and always with
a murderous-looking knife, these savage-looking
rovers were calculated to fill one with
misgiving as to their pacific intentions. After
having escorted us for a few moments, and
satisfied their curiosity by questioning our
yemschik, they started off at full speed, sometimes
standing upright on their stirrups, sometimes
bending close over the neck of their
courser, cleaving the air like the flight of a dart.</p>

<p>The Mongols, among whom we pulled up
the next day, were too much like those of the
preceding night to render it worth while to
say anything about these. I found it impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
however, to stay under their tent as soon
as I discovered what kind of a repast these
wretched creatures were crouched around.
There was a dead camel lying on the ground
at a few paces from their habitation: the cold
had contributed no longer to its preservation,
and all around there was a most repulsive
odour. These poor creatures, by cutting off
a slice of this carrion every day, hoped to have
meals for some time to come. When I entered
under their blackened roof in a cloud of smoke
from the smouldering camel-dung, they were
greedily devouring, without sauce, salt, or bread,
this revolting, putrid mess, fresh from the
pestiferous, reeking caldron of broth standing
beside their horrible meal.</p>

<p>We took good care, M. Marine and I, not
to boil the water for our tea in this pot; we
therefore retired from its unsavoury proximity,
and breakfasted on some mutton sausages,
with which I had provided myself. Then I
went to cleanse myself in the snow, a luxury
I was, through the thaw, unhappily deprived
of a few days subsequently, and, having emerged
from it as clean as a new penny, I stretched
myself on the ground till the horses had sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
rested and were ready to continue the
journey.</p>

<p>Whilst thus musing I watched a Mongol,
who came out of his tent, mounted a camel,
and disappeared in a turn of the valley, singing
joyfully all the way. I thought this incident
worth the consideration of philosophers who
speculate on the sources of happiness. Still,
for my part, I would rather be any animal,
however limited its enjoyment of life might
be, than this jubilant Mongol.</p>

<p>Our attention was fully occupied the next
day in searching intently the horizon to catch
the faintest trace of our caravan, which we
should now have been approaching. Between
Kiachta and Urga, there is no marked way,
and the traveller simply takes a southern course;
obstacles, however, in his path, may cause a
deviation of a few miles from the most direct.</p>

<p>We examined minutely with our telescopes
the Mongol encampments, the troops of camels,
and the least shadowy objects, and took long
turns in every direction, with no other result
than to discover that our eyes had been
deceived by some phantasm, which we had
taken for a group of vehicles and camels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
But, at last, two flags, waving in the wind
at the head of a caravan, came into view and
left us no longer in doubt that it was ours and
really close at hand.</p>

<p>One of the flags bore the Russian eagles,
and the other, containing a prayer, had been
placed there by the Mongol guide as a protection
for our journey. I was delighted to
see my poor Pablo again, who appeared to
me to be looking quite emaciated. He spoke
in the highest terms of my other companions
of the journey, with whom he was already on
an excellent footing. Having heartily saluted
and assured them that it would not be my
fault if we were not the best friends in the
world, and then having patted lovingly the
poor ox drawing my empty vehicle, we continued
our way.</p>

<p>A few hours afterwards and just as the
darkness was closing in we saw, starting up
before us, the dark outline of something
very strange. On approaching we found it
was an idol, quite open to the sky and to the
desert, representing probably the deity of
travellers. It was made of compressed bread,
covered over with some bituminous substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and perched on a horse of the same material,
and held in its hand a lance in Don Quixote
attitude. Its horrible features were surmounted
with a shaggy tuft of natural hair. A great
number of offerings of all kinds were scattered
on the ground all around. Five or six images,
formed also of bread, were bending in an
attitude of prayer before the deity.</p>

<p>We looked slyly and cautiously all around
the horizon, and, in spite of the supplication
of our timid yemschik, we laid violent hands
on the ample treasure. We at first snatched
up several offerings, then seized a few idolaters,
and finally, seeing no impediment, I wrung off
the head of the god himself and threw it into
my big bag. Having committed this sacrilege,
we scampered off from the desecrated
altar with all the precipitancy of guilty
consciences pursued by an avenging spirit.
I was not long after all in regretting my
sacrilege, for the principal booty, the head
of the god, crumbled away from the shocks of
the vehicle so as to be no longer recognizable.</p>

<p>We were roused the following morning by
the sudden, furious scamper of our horses.
The driver had fallen asleep and then dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
the reins to the ground: the animals, scared
with something clinging to their heels and
finding themselves unrestrained, went straight
before them, leaping over ditches, earth
mounds, and obstacles of all kinds that came
in their way. The most vigorous shouting,
or the most soothing <i>trémolos</i> from the lips of
the yemschik, were of no avail; they kept on
their mad, <i>vent à terre</i> course.</p>

<p>Our driver then, like a true, devoted subject
of the Emperor of Russia, as he was, did not
hesitate at the critical moment to expose his
life, when, in his conscience, it was imperative
to save the lives of other subjects of the same
Emperor. Whilst we held him suspended by
the feet between the vehicle and the horses, he
was&mdash;hanging in this way&mdash;enabled to gather
up the reins which had already become entangled
around the legs of one of the horses.
A violent kick or fling, in this dangerous position,
might have fractured the skull of this
brave fellow, whose only fault had been the misfortune
to have been suddenly overcome with
too much fatigue, and whose devotion we did
not fail to reward as it merited, when we
arrived at Urga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
But our trouble did not end here: we had
unfortunately lost our way.</p>

<p>Not one of us knew how long we had been
at the mercy of our team and, consequently,
how far we had strayed. After going one
way, then another by chance, having nothing
but the sun for a guide, our Buriat began to
despair of finding the right way. In this
dilemma, we resolved to ascend a high
mountain and scan the horizon all around,
but M. Marine and I being of course quite
ignorant of the conformation and chief
features of the country, the driver alone undertook
this ascent. This accident and its
consequences caused us to lose a whole day,
but when he returned, happily, he was confident
as to the route he had to take, and we set off
in the same state as the pigeon in the fable,
believing this time, our troubles would end
with this trial.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded very far before we
were most annoyingly stopped by a watercourse.
We feared that its covering of ice
was too fragile to bear us, and, on the other
hand, it was apparently too treacherous to
admit of our sounding it. After my adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
on Lake Baikal, I was quite prepared
to trust myself over this ice without much
hesitation, but, seeing the apprehensions of
M. Marine and the driver, I became timid, and
yielded to them.</p>

<p>We got out of the tarantass; M. Marine
and I first went across on foot, and then the
driver, after starting the horses at a gallop,
followed us. The resistance of the ice was
just sufficient, and the next day, probably, we
could not have crossed, for the ice even now
split under the weight, spurting up the compressed
water everywhere through the inauspicious
fissures.</p>

<p>We still had a mountain to ascend before
arriving at Urga, and as our jaded horses
crept up with difficulty, we got down to relieve
them. Our attention was at once attracted
by the picturesqueness of the scenery. As
we advanced, the valleys around us coming
into view, deepened in shadow and narrowed
in width; the crests of the overhanging mountains
were beginning to catch the first rays of
the rising sun, and fascinated us with their
luminous splendour. It called up, in my
memory, my former excursions in the Alps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
and the Pyrenees. I loitered on my way
musingly for some time, and tried to abstract
my thoughts from actuality; from the perils
of my adventure, the remoteness from my
friends, and indulged in the illusion that I had
before my eyes the snowy cap of Mont Blanc
or the Maladetta. But this attractive imagery
was soon rudely dispelled by the sight of two
or three Mongolian tents on the summit of the
hill we had to ascend. These were too forcibly
suggestive of the first encampment I had
visited to permit me to indulge any longer
in a day-dream that I was so near my home.
We resumed our places in the tarantass, and
our descent of the mountain, across snow-pits
and boggy spots, in the absence of any roadway
whatever, kept us in perpetual alarm.
The valley into which we descended, was
strewn with huge stones, and we could not
proceed, even at a snail’s pace, without being
tossed with fearful joltings. This wearying
movement lasted five or six hours, and M.
Marine became quite exhausted and alarmingly
pale from the effects. Towards one in the
afternoon, we perceived a grand lamasery
gracefully rising on the slope of a mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
and, in another hour, we at last arrived at
Urga, the capital of Mongolia.</p>

<p>The Russian consul, to whom I had a letter
of recommendation, does not live in the city,
and the reason will soon be apparent. His
government has built a fine residence for him
in the Siberian style, about two miles distant,
and he has been living there twenty years with
his wife, protected by two companies of Russian
gendarmes, opening his house to travellers,
who rarely present themselves, and having
beyond this no other incidents to enliven his
existence than he can find in the neighbourhood
of this city, into which I will invite the
reader to enter with me.</p>

<p>The streets are bordered right and left with
palisades of trunks of trees, placed upright and
strongly bound together, and these are pierced
here and there, on each side, by gates of the
same material and kind of construction, which
give access into courts, where tents, exactly of
the same character as those I have already
described, are permanently pitched. The
Mongols are essentially nomads, and would
not, even in towns, live in any other kind of
habitation. The governor of Mongolia, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Grand Lama, the highest dignitaries, live here
also under tents. The lamasery, the <i>Koutoukta</i>
palace, and the prison, alone stand out above
the other strange constructions, but since these
three principal are raised commandingly on a
series of logs one above the other, they break
slightly the monotonous aspect of the whole.</p>

<p>The lamasery is tolerably rich in its contents.
The principal idol placed in the centre is cast
in copper, sixty feet high; and around this are
disposed several other personages, also of
copper. Niches are also sunk along the walls,
and contain other little copper idols: I counted
twelve hundred of them. Flags and banners
of precious stuffs embroidered with gold adorn
this temple, but prevent one, through intercepting
the view, from appreciating the general
effect. On the right of the principal god a
platform is raised for the <i>Koutoukta</i>, who takes
his place here during the ceremonies. This
<i>Koutoukta</i> is the favourite deity of the Mongols.
He is brought here from Thibet by the Grand
Lama of Urga, who goes into this country to
search for him, guided probably by the
indications of the other lamas of the country.
The child lives retired in the recesses of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
building, to which they give the pompous
name of “palace.” Through some strange
fatality, a fatality always renewed, this living
deity never survives the age of eighteen or
twenty years. The cause of this cruel destiny
may be traced, I think, to the apprehensions
of the government of Pekin, who, jealous of
the influence the <i>Koutoukta</i> exercises over the
Mongol population, fears it might become
dangerous if protracted beyond this age. As
to the prison, it consists of two enclosures
about eighteen feet high, constructed also with
trunks of trees.</p>

<p>Such is the external aspect at first sight;
the internal life it covers is much more
singular.</p>

Holy Mountain&mdash;My travelling companions in the
desert&mdash;Departure from Urga&mdash;First halt&mdash;A Mongolian
repast&mdash;Easter Eve.</p></blockquote>

<p>The thought of death and a future life hovers
constantly over this mournful city, and lugubrious
religious ceremonies constitute the
principal occupation of its fanatical inhabitants.
Banners inscribed with prayers are all around
the palings surrounding their tents, everywhere
fluttering in the breeze; but, as if these
were insufficient, certain fanatics stretch a cord
around below this row of banners, and
suspend oriflammes therefrom covered with
pious texts. These stuffs of every colour, as
thick as blossom on a peach tree, in lively
agitation from the slightest breeze and glittering
in the sun, give to this city the aspect of
a perpetual fête, contrasting most singularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
with the funereal atmosphere one breathes
here amid so many obtrusive relics of the dead.</p>

<p>Their chief religious exercise consists in
turning round on an axis like a horse in a mill
a great drum, crammed with a countless
number of written prayers. In the eyes of the
faithful, to obtain a turn or two of this miraculous
wheel in their favour, is to procure for
themselves all the blessings they could hope
to attain if the prayers it contains had been
turned over on their tongues, or, perhaps,&mdash;could
they only see the perfunctory procedure
of a more enlightened race,&mdash;as others are
sometimes turned over in a book without a
handle. These praying wheels are quite an
institution throughout the country. They are
seen in the streets of Urga at every thirty or
forty paces, and of sufficient size to accommodate
a working team of four or five men at a
time. Around the lamasery where they are
sown broadcast from eighty to a hundred may
be counted. Notwithstanding the wheels are
as plentiful as fire plugs in civilized cities, and
much more accessible when wanted, and, moreover,
are as full of prayers “as a pomegranate
is full of seed,” they are still insufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
certain Mongols of exemplary piety feeling
the need of private devotion, and who make
up for the deficiency by turning a little portable
wheel in the left hand, whilst their right
is fully employed in the public duty of working
the big machine of their district. These praying
wheels are furnished with two bells, the one
having a grave and the other an acute note,
which thus indicate by their tone every turn
and half turn: an incessant chime is accordingly
heard here which contributes very much
to the picturesqueness and grotesqueness of
this strange spot.</p>

<p>It is not allowed to enter the space before
the palace of the <i>Koutoukta</i>, either on horse or
camel or in a carriage. The rite imposes the
duty to approach on foot, but the majority
make of it a work of supererogation and only
come crouching on their knees.</p>

<p>But among the curious customs of this
people, the most singular are the ceremonies
that accompany death and the disposal of the
dead.</p>

<p>It is a great misfortune in the eyes of the
Mongols to die in one’s tent: for the entry
into paradise is not only closed against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
defunct, but a sort of unlucky fatality surrounds,
for the future, the dwelling thus contaminated
by the presence of a corpse.</p>

<p>As soon as an inhabitant of Urga is seized
with a malady considered incurable, and there
is no hope of his recovery, he is carried to
a chamber, called the chamber of the dying,
a kind of funereal building annexed to the
lamasery. When the patient is once there, he
is in the hands of his priests, who, far from
thinking of any remedy for his disease or of
giving the least humane assistance, busy themselves
merely with saving his soul.</p>

<p>I had the curiosity to enter this abominable
hole; but I must admit, I remained there so
short a time, that I can give no adequate
description of it. I witnessed the lugubrious
spectacle of five or six men or women,
stretched on carpets on the ground, in the
agony of death. But to finish as soon as
possible with this gloomy subject, we will now
accompany a corpse to its last resting place.</p>

<p>The body is wrapped in a winding sheet of
blue linen, but with the face exposed, and
carried to a spot about half a mile on the
north-east of the town. Arrived here, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
deposited on the ground, and the mourners
standing all around begin filling the air with
their piercing shrieks. Hardly has this frightful
uproar set in than, on looking round, some
enormous dogs are seen prowling about, and
while these are watching with ferocious eyes,
a hoarse croaking is heard in the air, and
suddenly ravens and vultures are seen hovering
overhead with their sable wings outspread,
trembling with impatience. But these hideous
specimens of animal life, which nature seems to
have strangely adapted to their horrible <i>rôle</i>
in bestowing on them beaks and claws of blood-red,
have not long to wait; for, in about ten
minutes, the friends of the deceased, tired of
howling, embrace one after the other the feet
of the dead and then retire covering their
faces. So soon as the spot is cleared nothing
can equal the horror of the scene that
takes place. The dogs skulk no longer, but
advance snarling and growling at one another
all the way, whilst the birds voraciously pounce
down, filling the air with their sinister croaking.
An hour after the ceremony, nothing remains
of the dead but the skull and the winding
sheet; but he who has been a spectator of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
diabolic repast&mdash;resembling in every way that
of the dream of <i>Athalie</i>&mdash;has been so profoundly
moved, that he will not, for a long
time to come, be able to purge his memory
of so ghastly a spectacle.</p>

<p>All this side of the town is strewn with
skulls and shrouds: it is almost impossible to
advance without striking the foot against the
one, or getting it entangled with the other.
Some lying on the surface and crumbling
away, are sometimes carried by the wind to a
long distance; others are partially decomposed
and lie confounded with the earth. When
cyclones visit this district, and the wanderer
has the misfortune to encounter their sweeping
clouds of dust, he trembles to think what he
may be breathing or grating between his
teeth.</p>

<p>I returned to the Russian Consul’s with my
mind quite troubled with what I had just
seen: but I found a great distraction in the
delightful evening I passed with his family,
and in chatting about St. Petersburg and
Paris, which my kind hosts knew very well
and hoped to visit again soon. I learnt, however,
this evening, some sad news: two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
three merchants forming the first caravan, of
whom M. Pfaffius had spoken to me with the
thought of joining me, had died; one during
the journey from Kiachta to Urga, and the
other shortly after having left the Mongolian
capital. I went to visit the two fresh graves
of those who might have been my travelling
companions, and I blessed my stars that
Lake Baikal had thus retarded my arrival at
Kiachta.</p>

<p>The next morning I went to take a walk,
with the young interpreter of the Consulate,
over a neighbouring mountain, known by the
name of the Holy Mountain. It is an object
of great veneration, and cannot be ascended
otherwise than on foot. It is not permitted to
cultivate the smallest plot or to cut a single
tree there; so that this is the sole wooded
mountain amid the immense bare surface of
Mongolia. The inhabitants of this dismal land
often leave their homes and retire into the
recesses of this wood to meditate here, weeks
and even months in gloomy solitude over the
vanities of the things of this world, and to
enjoy the consolation procured by leading the
life of an anchorite. I saw several of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
hermits, established in the depths of the wood,
occupied incessantly in turning their devotional
wheel, and who charitably offered to
intercede for us with the <i>Koutoukta</i>.</p>

<p>During my sojourn at Urga, I regretted
very much my inability to pay a visit to this
young divinity. He had died about six weeks
before my arrival in the Mongolian capital.
I was equally disappointed at not having seen
the Grand Lama, who had gone into Thibet,
to hunt for another little god. I was all the
more sorry, inasmuch as the Russian Consul
told me he could, through the Chinese
Governor, have enabled me even to approach
the feet of the <i>Koutoukta</i>. I should thus have
been enabled, for a few moments, to interpellate
a god on things of the other world.
Such a revelation no doubt, if given to the
world, would have assured a great success to
this book, for the latest novelties in spirit
rapping would have shrunk into insignificance
by comparison.</p>

<p>Day after day went by, and our caravan
we passed on the road, had not yet made its
appearance on the horizon. A young Russian
had just arrived in a carriage from Kiachta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
and had seen nothing of it on the way; I
began therefore to get a little uneasy, for I
had confided to Pablo not only my baggage,
but also my fortune. It will easily be understood
that a large sum in <i>tea bricks</i>, the only
money current in Mongolia, and also in silver
pieces, with which I was obliged to provide
myself for my future journey in China, constituted
altogether cumbersome luggage. I
should, certainly, not have acted in this way
with everybody, but Pablo was quite an exceptional
servant on the score of scrupulous
honesty. I had not a moment’s uneasiness
from a fear that he had fled with the cash:
I depended, moreover, on his continual and
salutary apprehensions; still, I feared that some
evil had visited the caravan, or that Pablo
had died, two events, after all, to me not
improbable. Fortunately nothing of the sort
happened; for, on the fifth day after my
arrival at Urga, he presented himself in my
room. He at once took my hand and, in the
manner of the Turks, pressed it on his forehead,
and laid down the key of my carriage
like a soldier laying down his sword. Our
Mongol guide asked for a day’s delay, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
he might have time to sell the oxen and buy
camels, required for drawing the carriages. I
then had time before leaving to become
acquainted with my new companions.</p>

<p>M. Schévélof, the leader of the caravan,
was about thirty-eight or forty. He was
making the journey from Kiachta to Hankow
for the seventh time. His complexion was
quite yellow from fevers and liver disease
contracted in South China. He spoke Chinese
and Mongolian most fluently, and was at
once our mentor and our interpreter; consequently,
if we had lost him on the way, I
do not know what would have become of us.</p>

<p>There was also M. Kousnietzof, a young
man of twenty, a native of Verchni-Oudinsk,
not related to the millionaire I have mentioned,
but a young man of the same name leaving
his native city for the first time. Like a true
Siberian of pure race, he had thick blonde hair
that hung down to the middle of his back,
and not a filament of down on his chin. Being
accustomed to the great boots and full blouse
of the Russian national costume, he was not
only uncomfortable in the trousers and short
coat he had put on for the occasion of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
journey into China, but he imagined he was
dressed in a manner quite indecent: therefore,
to avoid a blush on his cheek, on presenting
himself in the drawing-room of the Consul’s
wife, he had improvised for himself, as he
thought in the most becoming manner, a kind
of <i>jupon</i> with his new shirt, by employing that
part the most scrupulously concealed, to cover
the indelicate nakedness of a simple pair of
trousers.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find perhaps a more
striking, and at the same time a more
amusing illustration, of the predominance of
conventionalism in the sentiment of modesty.</p>

<p>M. Marine came from Tobolsk, his native
city. He was acquainted with Omsk, the Ural,
and Catherineburg; he had been once even
as far as Perm, and spoke enthusiastically of
his distant travels and of what wonders he had
formerly seen in the West. His incessant
complaining, his slowness and heaviness of
manner in body and mind, wearied us a great
deal at first, but later we turned all these
weaknesses to our amusement, at his expense,
and thus this poor sufferer became, I am
ashamed to say, the butt of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
It was on the 8th of April when I took
leave of the Russian Consul at Urga, whose
name, I regret, I have forgotten. As he was
about to leave shortly for St. Petersburg with
all his family, we could wish each other,
mutually, <i>bon voyage</i>. He accompanied me as
far as the gate of his grounds, and, after a
cordial hand-shaking, I accomplished on foot
the two first <i>kilomètres</i> of the five hundred
leagues of desert I had to travel over.</p>

<p>On marching thus behind a conveyance,
which was to be, for many days to come, my
sole habitation, I imagined myself, for an
instant, like the <i>Chevalier des Grieux</i> attached
to a company of strolling players. No one,
alas! in the caravan, could complete the
illusion by presenting to my imagination, even
in the remotest way, the pretty face of <i>Manon
Lescaut</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_332" class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;"><img src="images/i381.jpg" width="433" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">PRAYING MILL AT URGA. (<i><a href="#Page_322">p. 322</a>.</i>)</div></div>

<p>M. Schévélof’s carriage led the way; it
was surmounted with a Russian flag and a
Mongolian prayer banner. Then followed
M. Kousnietzof’s vehicle, and then fourteen
camels, carrying the baggage, marching in a
line one after the other. Among this baggage
there were two tents; one for us, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
other for the Mongols, and besides a set of
cooking utensils. And then the rear was
brought up by Pablo’s carriage, M. Marine’s,
and my own. We were accompanied by seven
natives, who were under a chief on horseback,
and these natives, mounted on camels,
guarded, each from his elevated position, the
portion of the caravan under his care.</p>

<p>We began by threading our way through
a fine mountainous country, but scattered all
over with huge stones, which, coming in
contact with our wheels, gave us a most unpleasant
shaking. Towards eleven at night,
we halted, but pitched one tent only, intending
not to remain long at this spot. This
time, we had the luxury of fresh provisions,
which we had brought with us from Urga,
and, after we had dined, we went to see the
Mongols at their repast.</p>

<p>They quickly lighted a fire with camel-dung
in the middle of the tent, and having set over
it a caldron filled with water, they threw into
it a whole sheep that had just been roughly
hacked into seven portions without any method.
This had hardly simmered a quarter of an hour,
when the chief gave the signal to begin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
With their eyes glaring with ravenous impatience,
they all, like beasts of prey, rushed
around the caldron, and seized each a portion,
which they began tearing and devouring,
without bread or salt, cracking and crunching
the bones between their teeth, and bolting with
painful efforts whatever impeded this savage
feat of gorging. This enormous quantity of
flesh, the whole sheep in fact except the large
bones, was despatched with the celerity of a
carcass before a pack of voracious wolves,
whose feeding, rather than a human repast of
the most savage race even, it so strongly
resembled.</p>

<p>Since the Mongols have the custom of
simply depositing their dead on the ground,
they should, from a desire to avoid a similar
treatment of the remains of animals, dispose
of these otherwise, either by burial or burning.
It was the latter process our guides adopted
this evening, A most repulsive odour soon
filled the tent and compelled us to quit it,
and as there was no other retreat than our
carriages, we turned into them and slept profoundly.</p>

<p>Our slumbers, however, were of short duration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
for we were suddenly awoke by the cries
of our men, who were running after one of
our pack camels. This poor beast, having
probably already experienced the fatigues of
the passage of the Gobi, naturally desired to
escape from our caravan. Having luckily
shaken off, by his bounding, two little chests
that were attached to his back, and which
happened to belong to me, he had wandered
away in the wide desert, or perhaps to the
wood on the Holy Mountain, which we had
skirted in our route. In short, we never saw
him any more, and the accident hindered
us from striking our tent this night. Our
guide was obliged to go and buy another
camel at Urga, and consequently we could
not resume our march till ten in the morning.</p>

<p>On the third day we arrived at the foot of a
chain of mountains that formed the limits on
this side of the desert proper. As the laden
camels cannot ascend any hill, our guide hired
oxen of the Mongols, who are established on
this side of the range to let them for this
purpose. It took us four hours to reach the
summit, and when I had got so far, I turned
to the north to contemplate, for the last time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
the magnificent Altái mountains, whose crests
covered with snow now shut out Siberia from
my eyes; and I bid adieu for ever to its wintry
scenes. In this glance I could trace the whole
of the wrong route I had just followed, and
when I turned to the south, where not a flake
of snow was visible, my thoughts brightened
with the prospect of spring over the verdant
plains of China, which I hoped soon to reach.</p>

<p>We at last entered the great Desert of
Gobi, and began a journey which happened
to be of eighteen days’ duration across this
dreary waste.</p>

<p>We stopped but very little on the way, and
I wondered how camels, animals that appear
so lank and so loose in their framework,
could support so much fatigue. We pitched
our tents about eleven in the morning, and,
while stationary for about two hours, our
camels pastured on some sparse grass. When
we started the caravan did not stop again
till eleven at night.</p>

<p>The night halt, during which the camels
slept, did not last more than an hour, and then
we went on again without stopping till eleven
in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
The centre of the Desert of Gobi resembles
the Sahara. It is a sea of sand, over the
whole extent of which there is no object whatever
to arrest the eye. When a little later
we got further into it, and during the four
days which it took us to cross the part wholly
void of vegetation, our camels accomplished
their work as usual without taking the least
nourishment. The last day only, several of
them stopped and began to lie down, as if
to make us understand their extreme fatigue.
A few blows with the stick soon set them up
on their legs again and, in the end, not one
dropped altogether. The horse that our guide
had bought at Kiachta, and whose forage of
hay and oats was borne by the camels, died at
the end of a week, and another, we had bought
of the Mongols we met accidentally on our
way, shared the same fate. We had here a
striking proof, under our eyes, of the superiority
of the camel over the horse in supporting prolonged
fatigue.</p>

<p>The Mongol leader of our caravan had a
thorough knowledge of the desert. During
the day he followed, generally, the still visible
traces of caravans; skeletons of camels, horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
or sometimes of oxen, which we saw scattered
here and there. At night, he kept his eye
on a star, as the mariner does on a distant
pharos, and marched straight towards it without
looking at the ground, like the Magi of
the Gospel. Sometimes, however, the sky
was covered with clouds and the ground presented
no traces of former passages; but
these accidents in no way embarrassed him,
he continued guiding our caravan towards
Kalkann with the calm assurance of a navigator
steering his ship towards some port still
beyond the reach of vision.</p>

<p>At one night halt, four days after leaving
Urga, M. Schévélof reminded us that the next
day the orthodox church would celebrate the
feast of Easter: “We must,” he said, “on
this occasion, give ourselves up to some enjoyment.”
The project was cheerfully adopted.
M. Marine ran out and soon brought in some
<i>bonbons</i>, which he distributed to begin with;
and then I said, “I will provide some
delicacy for supper,” and hastening to my
carriage, I quickly selected and brought in a
tureen of <i>foie gras</i>, a stock of which I had
laid in. M. Schévélof opened a bottle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Crimean wine, and we sat down to a jolly
repast.</p>

<p>The Mongols, hearing our merry-making,
came and squatted down at the entrance of
our tent, and began discussing the delicate
qualities of our repast, some vestiges of which
they picked up from the ground with avidity.
Young Kousnietzof, impatient to contribute
his share to the festivity, also left the tent, but
instead of returning with some dainty, came
in tuning a guitar, which he played delightfully,
soothing us with some of the melancholy
thoughts of Wassili-Michäelovitch.</p>

<p>This group of five wanderers, squatting
around a fire in this little habitation, the sole
plot lighted in the midst of the deep solitude
and silence of the immensity of the desert, with
the party of Mongols grouped in their national
costume at the entrance, presented a highly
picturesque tableau. The hour of the night,
the loneliness of the spot, our remoteness from
civilized life and the strangeness of our surroundings,
found us in no mood for protracted
gaiety, and this soon gave way to silent
reverie more in harmony with the solemn
incident and the tender melancholy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Russian airs. We should certainly, in this
mood, have forgotten the hour, if our Mongol
chief, more sensible to the exigencies of the
desert than to the notes of the guitar, had not
suddenly appeared to warn us of the necessity
of departure. In a quarter of an hour the
tents were folded and packed; we recommenced
our march, and the little spot, that
had served us as the site of our temporary
habitation, no longer presented any mark to
distinguish it from the rest of the desert.</p>

<span class="subhead">CARAVAN ACROSS THE DESERT OF GOBI.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">A Mongolian Prince and his Court&mdash;Prayer turning&mdash;Our life
in the desert&mdash;The sandy plain&mdash;Want of water&mdash;Lunar
mirage&mdash;Three executions&mdash;A traveller astray in the desert&mdash;Arrival
at Kalkann and the Great Wall of China.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following morning was ushered in with
a wind so violent that no one attempted to
emerge from his shelter, and, singular enough,
this Easter day, which ought to have been
passed in rejoicing, disappeared without anyone
having sought the society of his fellow
travellers. The weather the following day
was not better, and we had, in addition, several
hail showers that quite whitened the surface
of the desert. Therefore, we did not break
from our long confinement till the approach
of evening, when M. Schévélof descried, with
the aid of his telescope, far away, a large
assemblage of tents. On drawing nearer we
perceived to our disappointment that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
were not inhabited by Europeans; for our
guide soon discovered that it was a halt of
a Mongolian prince, surrounded with his
court.</p>

<p>About a score of tents were pitched beside
each other, and that of the prince was distinguished
by its larger size and by its being
enclosed with a kind of wall covered with
coarse paintings. Another of about the same
size, surrounded with <i>praying-wheels</i>, appeared
to be the temple of the tribe. On our
approach the dogs, that guarded each a tent,
set up such a barking and howling that the
whole community was stirred up with alarm.
Many of the inhabitants seeing, in the distance,
we were strangers, came out to meet us from
curiosity, and, at the same time, to be assured
of our pacific intentions. After an interview
between one of these and M. Schévélof, the
latter informed us we were to be admitted
to the presence of the prince.</p>

<p>The simplicity and bareness of his tent
astonished me. There was nothing special
to be seen in the interior but a little stove,
with a pipe leading from it through the top
of the tent. The sole luxury, therefore, of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
princely habitation, consisted in a precaution
against asphyxia, a danger to which all
others in tent life are exposed through the
noxious and nauseous smoke. He was squatting
on a carpet, and was clad in an ample
blue silk robe edged with black velvet, his
feet being covered with a kind of black silk
boots. His belt, to which were attached all
the requisites for smoking and the production
of fire, as is usual with the Mongols, was
embroidered with silver. His head was covered
with a cap of yellow leather, having the
border in fur turned up, and surmounted with
a blue ball, from which hung a little tuft of
hair.</p>

<p>As soon as we entered, he drew from his
pocket a little bottle filled with essence of
tobacco, which he presented to M. Schévélof.
Our leader then withdrew the stopper, to which
was attached a minute spoon, took in this
a drop of the essence and bore it to his nose,
affecting to be highly delighted with the effect,
and then, replacing the stopper, passed it to
M. Marine, telling him to repeat the same
ceremony. When we had, all five of us, gone
through this pantomime of simulated joy, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Pablo did not miss the opportunity of keeping
close to my side to share in this novel
ceremony, it was necessary to say something.
This delicate mission, of course, was the duty
of M. Schévélof, who acquitted himself of it
with dignity. He then asked permission to
visit the temple, and this being accorded, we
went to see the lama, who offered to pray to
the god to bless the remainder of our journey.
As a recompense for this protection of a deity,
I presented him with a brick of tea, five needles,
and a bit of thread&mdash;a recompense in my
estimation ample enough, considering the cost
of the benediction, however highly cherished
might be its effect.</p>

<p>As soon as I retired to my carriage, it was
surrounded by five lamas who, prostrated
before it, were chanting prayers, each of them
turning all the time little <i>portable prayer wheels</i>.
This comedy was irresistibly ludicrous: the
sight of these grave priests, solemnly turning
their prayers as a child winds round a toy
windmill, was too much for my gravity, and
I was obliged to hide my irreverent laughter
in the far corner of my carriage. The grand
priest, however, soon opened the door without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
ceremony, to gratify his curiosity with its
contents. Not knowing what to do with my
visitors, I took a bottle of scent and presented
it to their noses, and they were so delighted
with the odour that I sprinkled them with it
just as the caravan began to march. Their
gratitude at this favour was unbounded: they
all bowed repeatedly in acknowledgment, and
when they were disappearing from my sight,
they were being mobbed apparently by the
members of the community, who had come up
to sniff at their shoulders, so wonderfully
odoriferous. This incident was, perhaps&mdash;judging
from the popular excitement&mdash;of
sufficient importance to them to be handed
down to posterity.</p>

<p>From this time we had beautiful weather,
and it became warm also. Our days passed
away much in the same way, it is true, but not
without pleasure and even merriment at times.
When the caravan halted in the mornings, we
all came out of our carriages. As we were not
in want of water during the first half of our
journey, at least for drinking, a discussion
usually took place every day, as they were
pitching the tents, between my companions, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
tea-making. Were they to have fine tea or
brick tea? Should they mix with it sheep’s
milk, wine, or lemon? Should it be prepared
entirely in the Mongolian way, that is, with
butter, flour, and salt? Many other suggestions,
too long to mention here, were made by
M. Kousnietzof and even Pablo who, having
lived in many lands, had also his methods.
When we had all refreshed ourselves, the tents
were struck, the camels resumed their march,
and, shouldering our guns, we wandered about
till five or six in the evening, when we joined
our carriages and fell in again with the march
of the caravan. Some pursued winged game.
M. Kousnietzof never finished the day without
having bagged a duck, or a partridge; the
latter of a kind common everywhere in Mongolia,
but still little known in Europe, with
feet covered with hair, not unlike rat’s feet.</p>

<p>For my part, I preferred hunting the white
deer and bucks, which we sometimes saw in
great numbers, but always at a long distance.
How many leagues have I not gone out of
my way in the hope of stalking one of these
animals! On one occasion, in particular, being
fully satisfied I had wounded one badly, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
led a pretty dance after it, and I do not know
where I should have wandered, if twilight had
not warned me that unless I turned back I
might lose sight of the caravan, and then go
astray in the middle of this desert&mdash;the greatest
desert in the world.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> See <a href="#note_14">note 14</a>.</p></div>

<p>M. Marine, through caution or fear of
fatigue, did not venture far from the caravan.
Sometimes, even, he used to sit at the opening
of his carriage, with his feet resting on the
steps, and, from this advantageous position,
pepper away at everything that came into
view, whatever animal it might be, or at whatever
distance it might be beyond gun-shot.
One day, however, M. Schévélof and I succeeded
in stimulating in him the ardour and
enthusiasm of a hunter, under circumstances
that amused us for a very long time afterwards.</p>

<p>I happened to be walking about half a mile
in advance of the caravan, in conversation with
its pleasant leader, when we perceived on the
ground a dead ermine&mdash;unquestionably dead,
as its putrid odour proved. We took it up and
perched it in a tuft of grass, raising its head
and pointing its ears to make it look as lively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
as possible; having done this we went to
M. Marine to inform him that an excellent
opportunity presented itself to have a good
shot. Full of excitement at a chance such as
he had long pined for on the steps of his
carriage, he advances slowly and noiselessly,
entreating us not to stir a peg, and to speak
only in whispers. He shoulders his piece, aims
carefully, fires, and sees nothing escape;
clearly he had bagged something at last.
“Bravo!” I exclaimed, with a movement as
if I intended to secure the animal in a bound;
and here the comic part of the incident began.
M. Marine stretches out his arm and with a
furious gesture stops me. I comply, and he
again takes aim with the greatest precaution,
whilst M. Schévélof is ready to split with
laughing. “Ah! this time he is surely
dead,” exclaimed M. Marine immediately after
the second shot. “But why did you fire
twice?” I asked. “I feared I might have
missed the first time, and that it might not
have heard the report.” After this reply we
had no end of fun with poor Ivan Ivanovitch.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we came on the great
sandy plain I have mentioned that forms the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
centre of the Gobi desert. The first day passed
pretty well: a certain gloom pervaded us, it is
true, though we did not pay much attention to
it. The second day was more trying. M.
Kousnietzof found that they had put a few
grains of salt too many in the tea: every one
seemed in the humour to complain. The third
day was still worse. Wassili Michäelovitch did
not even make his appearance in the tent
during the morning halt: with the excuse
that he had an interesting book to read, he
breakfasted in his carriage. We could not
have had more agreeable travelling companions,
but we all felt the depressing influence
of the bareness of nature&mdash;the emptiness of
space around us.</p>

<p>In the immense solitudes of Siberia there
are forests presenting diverse features that
relieve the eye with the change of colour or
form; on the open sea the waves are constantly
in movement, movement that is suggestive
of life and consequently engages our
sympathy; but here in the desert there is a
complete absence of change as well as movement.
There is nothing but an endless solitude
of silence and rest. Nowhere, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
except in the presence of the dead, or alone
among the tombs, of which the desert is
strongly suggestive, do we feel so doleful and
lonely, such an oppression on the spirits,
encompassed as we are by this endless and
changeless sandy waste.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the influence of surrounding
nature on the mind, we could not
resist the gloominess it inspired, and lounged
along, moping in our joylessness, one far apart
from the other.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> See <a href="#note_15">note 15</a>.</p></div>

<p>With our eyes cast down, we occupied ourselves
in picking up some rare stones with
which the desert of Gobi is scattered in certain
parts; large agates and many other minerals,
unknown to me, quite transparent, and tinged
with orange or green; the soil was quite
covered with these, presenting a gigantic
mosaic.</p>

<p>The Mongol chief declared one morning
that our provision of water was exhausted.
“I had reckoned,” he said, “on renewing the
supply from a pond here that generally contains
water, but you see the spot and that
it is quite dry.” This news, though rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
serious, caused a little diversion in the monotony
of our existence, and actually made us
merry. M. Schévélof and I alone had thought
of providing wine, and our stock of it was not
large. We had no tea this day, neither with
salt, sugar, nor flour; and our tins of preserves
had diminished considerably. Filling our
glasses with wine, so suddenly enhanced in
value, we drank a toast to the prospect of soon
finding water.</p>

<p>M. Kousnietzof who, like a true Siberian,
would have preferred half a cup of tea to a
whole bottle of the most delicate wine, could
not accommodate himself very easily to this
privation. He was occupied, all day long,
in inspecting the horizon around with his
telescope, and again resumed at intervals his
persevering work at night. “Wada! Wada!”
(water, water,) he suddenly calls out, stopping
the caravan, and pointing at a spot with a
bluish surface near the horizon. In our
enthusiasm we all jumped out of our carriages,
and began leading the camels that bore the
water kegs towards the indicated spot. M.
Kousnietzof ran and M. Marine danced with joy,
Pablo sang and I followed M. Schévélof, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
doubted, and he was the wisest of all. This
deceptive blue tint was produced merely by
a large bed of salt; so we returned, looking
rather <i>blue</i> ourselves, to our carriages. The
same night, we witnessed a deception of
another kind in a lunar mirage. This phenomenon,
which appears to be rather rare, is
one of the most graceful and enchanting
presented by nature. The landscape that
charmed our sight was certainly a phantom,
for it was far too dissimilar from any real
one to be met with in the middle of the
desert; and if I had not witnessed it myself,
I should certainly have believed, if my companions
had faithfully described it to me, that
they had been indulging in a flight of imagination.
We had before our eyes not only
a little lake reflecting the moonbeams from
its smooth surface, but we distinguished on
its borders the outlines of groups of fine
trees, and even some wading birds. Wassili
Michäelovitch, who at Verchni-Oudinsk had
never even heard of such a thing as a mirage,
went leaping towards this little lake, when the
Mongols stopped his enthusiastic course by
loud peals of laughter. It is probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
this phenomenon, however rare elsewhere, is
not uncommon in the Desert of Gobi, since the
natives accompanying us appeared in no wise
surprised at such a beautiful vision.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we came upon a little
pond of dirty water, quite stagnant, and
surrounded with skeletons of all kinds of
animals that had come there to quench their
thirst and then die. This water, in which I
did not venture to wash myself, was welcomed
by us as a God-send. The camels that had
not drunk for a very long while, and even,
till just previously, eaten anything for many
days, needed ample rest. We, therefore, made
here a long halt. After the repast M.
Kousnietzof began giving us some airs on
his guitar, and our caravan, that had been as
dull as the ditch water, cheered up a little.
We were still in the heart of this great
solitude, but we were confident that the most
difficult part had been passed, and we should
now overcome all further obstacles.</p>

<p>Five or six days later we fell in with a few
Mongols. Our leader exchanged one of our
camels that was jaded for one of theirs
fresh and strong: we bought, also between us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
a sheep. This day did not pass without some
excitement. The new camel had not yet been
broken in to any kind of work: it was therefore
necessary to begin by piercing a hole
through his nose, in order to pass a stick
through it for the purpose of taming and
leading him. This operation was not performed
without difficulty, for it is extremely
painful to the animal. And, besides, one of
our camels had its foot cracked; this kind of
accident happens pretty often at the end of
journeys, on account of the protracted fatigue
and the hardness of the ground. The Mongols
treat it by sewing together the wound, and
the suffering of the poor beast may be easily
imagined. But the principal business was the
killing of our sheep; the first Mongol appointed
by our leader for this work refused
to obey; he opened his robe, and showing us
a little copper idol suspended on his chest,
“I am a lama,” he said, “and I am forbidden
to spill blood, even the blood of animals.”
Another Mongol undertook the function of a
butcher, but he killed the sheep in a strange
way. He made a long incision in the
abdomen, and then thrust his arm into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
wound to seize the heart and stop its beating
by holding it fast.</p>

  <div class="caption">MY MONGOLIAN CARRIAGE.</div></div>

<p>An adventure, of which I was the hero,
caused some delay. About an hour after the
caravan had resumed its march, after the
usual night halt, the tether that attached my
camel to Pablo’s carriage got loose; and
the beast, feeling itself no longer drawn along,
stopped altogether. When my camel found
himself thus left behind, I was in the rear of
the caravan. The Mongols were sleeping
profoundly between the two humps of their
camels, and, consequently, not knowing that
anything was amiss, kept on their course.
The reader may imagine my sensations on
finding myself quite alone on awaking in the
morning. Fortunately I had the presence of
mind to avoid going in search of the caravan;
for if I had attempted to overtake it I should,
in all probability, have gone astray altogether,
and, perhaps, in this plight if any natives
had observed my weakness and inexperience,
they might have shown towards me little
benevolence and hospitality. I sat down on the
ground before my stupid-looking camel, with
a good mind to give him a sound beating: but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
fearing he might take flight, I was constrained
to treat him kindly, for I dreaded beyond
everything to be obliged to stir even a
hundred yards from the spot where I had
been left, because there I hoped to be found
again. This anxious loneliness, happily, came
to an end about ten in the morning. At
daybreak, the Mongols having perceived my
absence, stopped and turned back on the
traces of the caravan, spreading out in different
directions. I was soon led back, and the
caravan hailed my return with joyous shouting.
Pablo was quite overcome with joy on seeing
me safe again; his fidelity and attachment
could not be more strongly manifested.</p>

<p>The surface was now gradually becoming a
little hilly, and we were soon surrounded with
high mountains. The temperature had become
quite mild, and as the moon shone in all its
splendour, our journeying was now easy and
agreeable. The tents of the Mongols were
more numerous, and we met two or three
Chinese caravans going to Maimatchin. At
last the route, like the way on leaving Urga,
was again strewn all over with huge stones,
and these enabled our guide to announce to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
us that three days later we should come in
sight of the Great Wall.</p>

<p>When Mongolia is traversed from north to
south, the traveller rises gradually, without
suspecting it on account of the ease of the
ascent, to four thousand feet above the sea-level.
On arriving at this culminating point
the land is found cut almost perpendicularly
to the depth of this elevation, and in such a
manner that, to continue the route, it is
necessary to descend by a series of zig-zags
cut out by the hand of man, the descent of
which is as rapid as the most perilous
mountain paths of the Alps and Pyrenees.
It is along this peaked crest that the Great
Wall of China runs. It is not built of
brick, like the interior walls of Nang-Kao for
example, of which I shall say something hereafter,
and which many travellers erroneously
take for the true Great Wall. But the true
Great Wall that separates, in the first place,
Mongolia from China proper, is built of
stones laid over each other without cement.
Towers, placed at certain distances from each
other, are more solidly constructed, and have
thus more effectually resisted the wear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
time. This wall has the form of capital A
open: the others, which I believe are seven
in number, unless I passed more in the night
without having seen them, form as many
transverse bars.</p>

<p>When our caravan, after three days of
fatiguing march across the rough stony land
I have mentioned, reached the Great Wall of
China, it was about six in the morning on
the 29th of April. The sun appeared on the
horizon, and we could distinguish a series of
hills stretching far away into the interior,
with the intervening spaces veiled in cloud.
We could see these undulations of the Celestial
Empire to advantage at the great elevation
we had arrived at, and we sat down some time
admiring the magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>My attention was struck immediately by
the remarkable difference between the country
we had just travelled over and the one we
were about to enter. Behind me was a wild
uncultivated waste, and before me extended
that famous fertile land that bestows annually
on its people two crops of corn or rice, and
two crops of vegetables. On one side it was
an unpeopled desert, and on the other a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
swarming of human beings numbering probably
more than four hundred millions, and whose
assemblage of four hundred thousand even
constitutes but a village among its populous
cities. But a little while ago it was everywhere
bleak and barren, and for the future
it will be sunshine over rich verdant lands.
Thus much for the most striking advantages
on the side of China, to which may be opposed
others on the side of Mongolia. The air of
Mongolia was pure and invigorating; that of
China will be nauseating and unhealthy. The
soil was covered with a sand so coarse that
the most violent winds were unable to raise it:
the soil in future will be composed of a
dust so fine that the least breeze will lift it
in clouds, impeding the sight and respiration.
The Mongols were hospitable; the Chinese
will be hostile; the mere circumstance of
being there constitutes an offence in their
eyes, and one they would punish if they dared.
It would be difficult to find two neighbouring
countries more dissimilar than China and
Mongolia in the nature of the soil and in
the character of the inhabitants. The Great
Wall, which has separated them in the past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
does not seem by its ruin to bring them
nearer to one another in the future. If I
were asked which of these two peoples I
prefer, though it is difficult to compare a
civilized with a savage race, I should reply:
“The Mongol is superior to the Chinese in
honesty and disposition; but the latter to the
Mongol in talent and ingenuity in the arts.”</p>

<p>We descended on foot the zig-zags that
lead from the Great Wall to Kalkann. The
natives formed in two rows to see us pass.
They came from all parts, even from underground;
for they live in caves like the caverns
of Touraine, which they have scooped out
of the rock in the side of the mountain. The
women with their little feet walk with
difficulty, and holding a child by one hand
make use of the other as a balancing pole
to maintain their equilibrium. M. Schévélof
got into a rage two or three times with these
people, who pressed in around and would not
get out of the way to let us pass, and yet we
were only in the rural part. Five hours
after passing the Great Wall we came to the
bottom of the valley, which narrows here
almost to a gorge. The aspect of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
is picturesque. A little rivulet, which occasionally
swells out in width to fill the whole
valley, meanders along, sometimes at the foot
of an enormous rock, sometimes lost in a
thicket of verdure. Everything is pretty and
graceful, but strange in form and arrangement.
I recognised here the models of Chinese landscapes
I have seen in France, and which I
had always taken to be imaginary compositions.
Thus in the midst of this valley, formed
between two great hills of majestic dark rocks,
rises abruptly a pointed granite mound, on the
top of which is built a temple: a little further,
an enormous red rock is suspended, in a
manner incomprehensible, on the apex of a
cone of earth. The whole of this singular
bit of nature is variegated and enlivened by
trees, irregularly disposed here and there,
freshly decked in their vernal dress.</p>

<p>If the reader will picture to his fancy this
landscape, peopled with men of effeminate look
with long pig-tails, and women with painted
faces presenting the appearance of wax
figures, he will form some idea of the country
we traversed in descending from the Great
Wall of China.</p>

<p>We were hospitably received in a Chinese
house belonging to a Russian, a friend of M.
Schévélof. This house was charmingly situated
out of the town, on the other side of the
brook I have just mentioned, and, consequently,
in view of the mountain we had
lately descended surmounted with the irregular
outline of the Great Wall.</p>

<p>It was the last Russian house into which
I entered, and not the least agreeable. During
my leisure in the day I went to ramble about
this strange country and among the still more
strange people.</p>

<p>I lounged also many hours on the balcony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
of this house, where I took refreshments,
agreeably occupied in contemplating the scene
around me. I shall never forget these days
of <i>far niente</i> passed at Kalkann after the long
monotonous passage of the Gobi without
stages and almost without repose. I was
approaching at last the goal of my travels&mdash;that
city of Pekin, towards which I had been
almost daily moving for the last seven months.
I was indeed in China at last, and all my
surroundings forcibly impressed me with the
novelty of my situation. I was never tired
of watching every object, every incident, from
my observatory, and when evening closed in I
quitted it with regret.</p>

<p>Then we retired to a distant room. Wassili
Michäelovitch, as well as a young inhabitant
of Tien-tsin who happened to be visiting
Kalkann, played on the guitar, and, in listening
to the melancholy notes of their melodies,
I recalled to memory the far-reaching steppe
of Omsk and its changing aspects, the perilous
night adventure in the snow on leaving
Tumen, the savage grandeur of the frozen
Angara, the terrors of the lonely Baikal, Mrs.
Grant and Constantine&mdash;all my adventures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Siberia,&mdash;in fact, that now, with the rigours of
an Arctic winter, were things of the past.
The remembrance of all these incidents I
cherished with that genial sensation that is
experienced when we find ourselves safe at
the end of a series of perilous adventures,
provided they leave behind no ill consequences,
but, on the contrary, a feeling of congratulation
that we have so happily escaped them.</p>

<p>But what a contrast was this past to the
present! It was not simply a change of
country and people, but a change of the face
of nature; for the trees had put forth their
tender leaves and vied in brilliancy of tints
with the verdure of the ground, and the whole
was bathed in the genial beams of the warm
spring sun.</p>

<p>Still it is the destiny of a traveller, who
has before him a long journey to be accomplished
without delay, to be always on
the move. On the morning of the 3rd of
May, therefore, we had five palanquins brought
up for our accommodation. They are a kind
of litter without wheels, furnished with two
long shafts projecting before and behind and
supported by these on two mules. The mule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
in the rear is not put in without some trouble,
it being repugnant, apparently, to these
animals to go into the shafts head foremost;
they are, therefore, generally obliged to have
their eyes bandaged during the operation.</p>

<p>The palanquin with mules is the most disagreeable
vehicle I have ever travelled in:
in the first place the greatest care is necessary
to keep yourself quite in the middle, inasmuch
as the least movement on the one side or the
other disturbs at once the adjustment of the
harness. In the second place the two mules do
not step together or move in harmony, and
consequently there is a continual pitching and
jolting in every direction, producing as much
sickness and distressing fatigue as the movement
of the sea.</p>

<p>Our host would accompany us beyond
Kalkann; we, therefore, began our journey
afoot, going through the city from end to end.
We went inside the fortifications, which consist
of crenulated walls very solidly built, and
from these we had a good view of the
streets.</p>

<p>The attention is arrested at once by the
swarming of the population. The Arab bazaars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
the most thronged even, can give no adequate
idea of such a circulation. The noise of all
this is quite equal to the concourse. Every
shop-keeper considers it his duty to stand in
front of his shop to praise his wares. He calls
out to the passer-by, to invite him to come in
and buy, and, as every one strains his voice to
make himself heard over his competitor, it may
easily be imagined what a hurly-burly would
greet the ear on penetrating further into the
city.</p>

<p>Mule drivers, palanquin leaders, mandarins’
coachmen or carriers, scream also with all their
might to have the way clear. Conjurers and
tumblers are exercising their profession all
along the streets, some violently beating their
drums, others blowing their bamboo pipes with
all the vigour at their command to arrest
attention. But the concert of sounds is not
yet complete; children being drubbed are
squalling, and awkward people, that cannot
escape from being crushed, are screaming:
petty traders are violently quarrelling with
their rivals, and then comes the growl of the
tam-tam, marking, from time to time, the hour
or the intervals on the bourse. An early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
morning at Billingsgate, or at the Halles in
Paris, is quite peaceable in comparison with
the obstreperous precinct of a Chinese town.
Our ears were greeted with this uproar for
an hour without cessation in passing on our
way from one end to the other. M. Schévélof
turned round to me many times with a
wearied look, and exclaimed: “O Mongolia!
calm of the desert, how precious thou art, and
how I regret thee!” We arrived at last at
the limit of the town, passed through another
gate, and were in the country again, but
Chinese country without solitude and silence.
We took leave of our host, and a quarter of an
hour afterwards we were swinging in our five
palanquins, anxious to look out, but, following
the advice of Mr. Schévélof, we closed our
curtains and tried to escape from persecuting
curiosity.</p>

<p>When night had quite closed in I opened the
three windows of my palanquin, one on the
right, one on the left, and the other in front,
and was thus enabled to contemplate at my
ease the magnificent scenery amid which we
were travelling.</p>

<p>We had entered into a narrow and precipitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
ravine: it was indeed so narrow,
occasionally, that the palanquin had only just
room to pass. Massive rocks rising perpendicularly
were starting on our vision on all sides.
It was clear we were now travelling along the
crest of a mountain range, for gaps suddenly
appearing here and there opened to view fearful
precipices that made the head swim. The
wind was blowing violently all the evening;
and clouds flitting quickly over the face of the
moon gave, through the fitful movements of
light and darkness, a most fantastic aspect to
this bit of nature.</p>

<p>We fell in with a second wall, built also of
stone like the first, but in a better state of
preservation: we travelled some distance
over this wall, and our mules sometimes approached
so near the edge that they made us
tremble. The rear mule is especially disquieting
to the traveller unaccustomed to this
mode of locomotion, this one being obliged
to follow blindly the leading of the other; but,
unlike the leader, unable to pick its way with
the same liberty, and being drawn along at the
same time over the ground, which is hardly
visible; but at the moment the foot is ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
fall, might very easily take a false step and
draw everything with it over the precipice.
In several places the Great Wall, along the
top of which we were travelling this night,
turned suddenly in its course at a right angle;
and as our mules had the detestable habit like
those of the Alps to follow invariably the
edge of a precipice, it resulted that while the
leader was turning these angles the rear mule
must have marched in a line which would, if
prolonged a few feet, have led over the brink
of the declivity. In order, however, to accommodate
their course to each other, as the
rigidity of the shafts compelled them, a
struggle invariably took place between the
two, and, inevitably, at the most critical spot,
during which the poor traveller found himself
unpleasantly suspended a moment over the
angle of the fearful escarpment.</p>

<p>After a journey of sixty <i>lies</i>, about twenty
English miles, not without exciting moments,
but still in contemplating a phase of nature
unique, perhaps, in the world, we arrived at
Suen-oua-fou. No sooner had we passed the
fortifications of this village than our mule
drivers began uttering constantly repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
cries. There is no country more infested with
secret societies than China. Every inhabitant
of this empire makes it a point of honour to
belong to one or two of them. The cries of our
mule leaders were the rallying signals of those
to which they were attached. I wondered
what was the cause of this warning, but did
not discover it.</p>

<p>The hotel at which we stopped was disposed
like the houses of Maimatchin, already
mentioned: there was merely that difference
between the two which there is in France
between an inn and a palace. One thing in
particular deserves notice; it is that throughout
China, even in the most humble dwellings,
art may be recognized, not merely in the
general arrangement, but even in the minutest
details. The tables that are placed on the
estrade of every room, the stools, the little
cups out of which rice brandy is sipped, the
small teapots, the slender eating sticks, have
all an artistic form or look. It is very often
singular, and even occasionally a little far-fetched,
but everywhere may be witnessed
the predominance of artistic ideas, and every
object is interesting to examine. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
meal&mdash;a miserable low tavern repast this time,
and sadly adapted to the demands of European
palates&mdash;we soon stretched ourselves to sleep,
like the Chinese, on the estrade where we had
just dined.</p>

<p>The next day, the 4th of May, we passed over
a charming country; the loveliest I have seen
anywhere, except in some parts of Japan. We
followed constantly the course of a rivulet only
a few yards wide meandering along the foot of
a wall-sided cliff, the top of which was crowned
with large trees that formed a bower over the
stream and dropped from their spreading
branches long festoons of verdant tufty
creepers, coming down to caress lovingly the
bosom of the brook. We continued our way
through this attractive country for at least
sixty <i>lies</i> more, and at last arrived at an
immense village, called Ti-mih-gnih, about
eleven in the morning, where we breakfasted.
This, like all Chinese villages, was fortified,
and had outgrown its fortifications from time
to time, for there were several lines of enclosure
one within the other. It may surpass in size
Toun-cheh-ouh, with its population of 400,000
souls. It took us an hour to cross it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Perhaps the reader may wonder how good
government is ensured among such masses of
human beings, and may suppose that an
immense army is requisite for the emperor to
maintain his throne and his dynasty. Order
is secured almost without an army, and by
means of a secret police and the rigorous
application of the law by those who are
responsible for its maintenance. The father
of the family answers with his head as a gauge
for the conduct of his children; the mandarin
of the third class likewise for the order of his
district, etc. On the other hand, the father
has the power of life or death over his children;
and the mandarin likewise over the members
of his district. In case of conspiracy, therefore,
it may be suspected what takes place.
The father of a family, fearing the repressive
power of the mandarin, sacrifices his children
immediately he knows they are guilty. Before
revolution can reach so far as the imperial
palace, all the members of the administrative
hierarchy must have steeped their hands in it
with the conviction that they have all thereby
exposed their lives. Such an event, therefore,
is highly improbable. This explains also how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
many travellers have been witnesses of twenty
or thirty executions at a time, as they have
described in their narratives. If a mandarin
admonished of a grave crime in his district
spares a single accomplice, he is responsible
to his superior: he generally prefers, then,
to sacrifice a few lives, and thus be on the
right side for the safety of his own head, to
running the risk of overlooking a single
guilty one.</p>

<p>It is quite intelligible that with such
summary, arbitrary proceedings, the Chinese
government does not desire Europeans to
penetrate into its empire. They are, in short,
an imbecile race, who are so besotted as to
share the hatred of their government towards
us and sacrifice the missionaries we send
there rather than profit by them to obtain
their liberty.</p>

<p>On leaving Ti-mih-gnih the valley opened
considerably. The wind became so boisterous
that it caused our mules to yield to its force,
even so far as to expose them to the risk of
being blown over the edge into the river.
After a third march of sixty <i>lies</i> we reached
Chah-tchen. The evening passed away in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
the most disconsolate manner. The palanquin
journey and the Chinese <i>cuisine</i> superadded,
had indisposed us severely. M. Schévélof,
M. Wassili-Michäelovitch, and Pablo did not
even rise from their palanquins. M. Marine
and I only slept on the inn platform.</p>

<p>We were startled out of our slumbers in
the middle of the night by the report of fire-arms
in the court. We leaped up in a hurry,
convinced that one of our companions, and
probably young Kousnietzof, who had two
guns and a revolver, had been the victim of
an accident. Our fears were, however, immediately
calmed on seeing our friends in a
deep sleep. The discharge of fire-arms had
taken place undoubtedly in the street. A
Chinese man or woman had perhaps received
it full in the chest, an incident much too
trifling to interrupt one’s slumber in this
country.</p>

<p>We started early the next morning, and
having done fifty <i>lies</i> through an uninteresting
country we stopped to breakfast at Hrouaé-laeh-sien.</p>

<p>The Chinese villages, just the same as the
Arab villages, are very much like one another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
I was never tired, however, at every halt of
regarding this bustling movement, quite exceptional
and unknown in our western cities,
even the most commercial, such as London,
San Francisco, or New York. How many
types presented themselves in reality now!
types I had seen formerly only in albums,
or on folding screens. The street porter
balancing on his shoulder a pole of exaggerated
length, with little round cards
hanging from each end covered with dragons
or some fantastic figures; children with puffed-out
stomachs and three little tails of hair
hanging from their shaven crowns, one above
the forehead and the other two dangling near
their ears. The constant shaving till the age
of twelve or fifteen gives to the hair of the
back of the head an unusual vigour when
it is wanted to form a fine pigtail.</p>

<p>The habit of adults of preserving but a
single long tress behind, dates only from the
conquest of the Tartars and the establishment
of their dynasty. The conquerors
being Mahometans, and consequently fanatics,
endeavoured to impose the Koran throughout
China. They did not succeed in this object,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
but an edict promulgated by the Emperor,
requiring the head to be shaved in the Arabian
manner, preserving merely a little tuft of hair
on the crown of the head, commonly called
the <i>Mahomet</i>, continued in force. But as the
Chinese are artistic in everything they do,
they transformed the ludicrous little tuft of the
Arabs into a long thick silky tress. This
<i>coiffure</i> is, moreover, perfectly consistent with
the climate and the nature of the soil. It is
so in this way; the dust is so fine, and consequently
is so copiously raised by the lightest
breeze, that it is necessary after the least
travelling, or in Pekin after even an ordinary
promenade in the streets, to get into a bath
so soon as one reaches his home. Now all the
Chinese without exception have abundance
of hair, and if they were to keep it all on
their heads, it may easily be imagined what
care and trouble it would demand to cleanse
it, and if neglected, particularly by those
whose occupations compelled them to remain
constantly in the open air, what foul, dusty
mops they would have usurping the place of
head-gear. Exported and sold too, in such a
condition, these shorn chignons would evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
be less presentable to the ladies of England and
France, to whom China sends so many cargoes
of these delicate <i>objets de luxe</i>&mdash;the only valuable
remnants probably of so many decapitated
criminals.</p>

<p>They can, on the other hand, very easily
keep their pigtail free from dust, and as
spruce as a skein of silk, either by hiding it
under a cap, or by letting it hang under
their clothing. The peasants, who are obliged
during summer to work in the open field, use
this tress to fasten large wet napkins over their
heads as a protection against the fierce rays
of the sun.</p>

<p>It is astonishing, moreover, on entering
China&mdash;a country we in France have too long
ridiculed&mdash;to see what industry pervades the
people in everything they do, and especially
in their agriculture, which, however much it
may be favoured by the richness of the soil,
is nevertheless indebted for its prosperity to
the industry of the people.</p>

<p>With regard to this question I will refer
to a social organization well worth notice.
When a Chinese has merited by his services
a title of nobility, his son in due course inherits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
merely the title immediately inferior, and the
nobility thus descends, diminishing in rank in
the family from generation to generation until
it becomes definitely extinct, unless one of its
members render some service to his country
and thus regain the title originally granted
to his ancestors. No one, certainly, has more
veneration than I have for old French
families and ancient titles; but I should
always desire to have good reason to esteem
the men that are honoured by them as much as
I respect the bare names and titles themselves.
The ingenious Chinese institution gives an
ever active emulation to the nobility, a desire
all the stronger to render a service to the
country, since the title is always fading away,
because it is thought more dishonourable to
suffer this inheritance to become extinct by
those who have enjoyed it, than never to have
merited a distinction at all.</p>

situated at the foot of a little mountain that
carries the third wall&mdash;here a brick wall. As
we arrived rather early, and our inn was near
the gate of the town, we went to take a walk
along the ramparts, which consist of a great
brick wall four or five yards wide. I was
much astonished to see there two cannon
without carriages, lying abandoned as useless
lumber. Can it be true that cannon existed
in China long before we had any notion in
Europe of the properties of gunpowder? But
it is quite certain that no European expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
has penetrated so far as Tchah-tao. These
bronze cannon unfortunately bore no inscription,
nor even any mark that might indicate
their origin.</p>

<p>During this promenade M. Marine thoughtlessly
threw a stone from the ramparts, which
happened to hit a dog below. The proprietor
of the animal turned round in a rage, and
seeing that the projectile had been thrown
by a European, tried to excite the crowd to
take vengeance for such an outrage. The
opportunity was only too well appreciated,
and we were followed by more than five
hundred persons, in our retreat to the inn,
hooting, and showing a disposition to rush on
us. M. Schévélof made a sign for me to
retire with Pablo into some obscure corner,
and mounting on the platform began addressing
them to pacify their anger.</p>

<p>“We are not Europeans,” he earnestly
remonstrated. “We are Siberians; look at
our passports; the two peoples are brothers,
and you cannot doubt our friendly sentiments.”
A few Chinese who spoke Russian,
of which there are instances everywhere here,
replied in this language; the affair then came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
quietly to an end. Pablo and I did not venture
out of our hole till this mob was dispersed,
and M. Schévélof advised us on account of
the adventure to quit the village at daybreak.</p>

<p>This day we were to go through the famous
passes of Nang-Kao, between the village of
Nang-Kao and the portion of the Great Wall
the nearest to the capital&mdash;an attraction that
no tourist to Pekin disregards. Dreading the
shocks of the palanquin in so mountainous a
country, and desiring to enjoy as much as
possible the grand scenery at our ease, we
jogged along on asses, from Tchah-tao to
Nang-Kao. About an hour after we had left
the village, and having passed the brick wall
I have mentioned, we arrived at the pass, the
entrance of which is very narrow, and is
closed by a fourth wall.</p>

<p>The approach is by zigzags in the declivity
similar to those we passed between Mongolia
and Kalkann, and then, after crossing a fifth
wall, one enters into a narrow gorge extremely
picturesque. The Chinese doubtlessly
must have formerly regarded this spot
as the most formidable entrenchment against
the Mongols. In a gorge that can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
approached by an escarped road, and protected
by two walls surmounted with crenelated
towers and fortresses, there were certainly
the means of an obstinate defence for a long
time, even against an enemy very superior in
number. When the tourist has arrived at the
bottom of the valley the route is continued
amid remarkable sites constantly varied. I
will mention one only that struck me more
than the others by its originality and its
charming aspect.</p>

<p>The pass at this spot may be from about
twelve to sixteen yards wide.</p>

<p>The little river of Nang-kao occupies the
whole width of it, and scatters its waters amid
scores of rocks. Our little donkeys were
obliged to leap from one to another to clear
the passage between. The two walls of rock
forming the gorge overhang the river, and
come so near to one another at a certain
height that they admit through the opening
but a few rays to light up, in a mysterious
gloom, this sort of natural grotto. The
Chinese have scooped out a little temple in
the face of one of these rocks about ten yards
from the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
It is reached by steps cut out on the wall
of the rock, having the appearance of a
natural causeway. The entrance of the temple
is ornamented with sculptured wood painted
red and gilded, with lanterns and all sorts of
suspended ornaments. Nothing can be more
charming, or gayer and prettier, and at the
same time more Chinese than this little nook,
which is all at once a valley, a grotto, the
bed of a rivulet, and a sanctuary. Once in
my life only have I desired to be an idol.
Happy the god that dwells in such an enchanting
spot!</p>

<p>I was quite astonished on emerging from
this little temple to find on the other side
the walls of the rock sculptured in the
Egyptian manner, and kinds of modillions,
as in the land of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>The remainder of the pass of Nang-kao is
also very fine, but resembling too much many
similar my readers must have frequently seen
in their travels, to render it worth while to
describe it here.</p>

<p>But I may say briefly that it resembles
the entrance to the gorges of the Trent,
Roland’s Breach, and the valley of the Chiffa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
in Algeria; what may be seen and admired
very often in mountainous countries. I should
mention, however, a village gate, a kind of
triumphal arch in stone, sculptured, sunk, and
covered with dragons and fabulous monsters
in such a way that it may certainly be
reckoned among the <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of Chinese
art.</p>

<p>We crossed in due course the two last walls
of China, or, to speak more correctly, the two
last buttresses of the Great Wall of Kalkann,
and arrived at Nang-kao. I was delighted
to hear myself addressed in French on entering
this village by the Chinese mule drivers
and sedan carriers, and to see written on the
walls of the inn warnings in French to
travellers, such as this: “Défiez-vous du
maître de l’hôtel, c’est un hardi voleur;”
signed “Un officier de marine compâtissant
envers les étrangers;” and many similar.</p>

<p>The reason was, Nang-kao is often a place
of rendezvous for the <i>personnel</i> of the embassies
at Pekin; and the tourists who visit the
capital never omit going to Nang-kao and the
tomb of the Mignes, returning by the Summer
Palace and the Great Bell. It is the established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
excursion, just as to see the Mer de Glace of
Chamounix or the Righi of Lucerne.</p>

<p>After we had resumed our palanquins to
take our way to the village of Kouan-chih-lih,
M. Schévélof said to me: “We are obliged to
reach as quickly as possible the south of
China, and consequently to take the road to
Toun-cheh-ouh and Tien-tsin. We have just
decided on not going to Pekin; still, you are
not far from the capital here, and the time is
come to separate and say adieu.” “I will go
with you to the next stage, Toun-cheh-ouh,
and from there to Pekin,” I said, unwilling to
part till absolutely necessary. In truth this
sudden announcement of a separation, the
prospect of finding myself alone with Pablo in
an unknown country, among people that seemed
hostile and to whom I could not make myself
intelligible, inspired me with misgiving and
almost fear. The reader will see what curious
result this decision led to from what follows.</p>

<p>At the moment of starting we saw coming
into the court of the inn a palanquin borne
by two men. It contained, therefore, some
aristocratic personage; for in China such
a mode of locomotion is permitted only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
persons enjoying a certain dignity or holding
a certain rank in the hierarchy. The horse
and the mule palanquin may be used by everybody;
the carriage, and especially the carriage
having the axle far removed from the shafts,
as well as the palanquin borne by men,
are reserved for the aristocracy.</p>

<p>We, therefore, approached this privileged
vehicle as soon as we saw it enter into the
court of our inn, and presently there descended
from it a lady apparently rather pretty, if one
might say that a lady could be pretty under
a thick coat of paint, with the disadvantage
of extraordinary <i>embonpoint</i>. What I
specially remarked was the apparent absence
of feet. Under the ankle the leg ended in a
point like the end of a stilt or a wooden leg.</p>

<div id="ip_386" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i439.jpg" width="600" height="392" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MY PALANQUIN.</div></div>

<p>The poor woman, whom this conformation
indicated as a member of the high class, and
as one to be admired and envied by all fine
connoisseurs and people of the most refined
taste, could not take a single step, even
supported between her two servants. She
was carried from the palanquin, to be laid
down like anything else unendowed with power
of movement, on the platform of a distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
room. M. Schévélof was informed on questioning
the palanquin men that she was the wife
of a great mandarin, on his honeymoon tour.</p>

<p>We saw the happy husband arrive a few
minutes later; it will be sufficient to say he
was just like the governor of Maimatchin,
already mentioned. These Chinese husbands
of high rank should be free from any anxiety
on the score of their wives <i>running away</i> from
them, and at the same time be perfectly
satisfied with the important guarantee they
hold for obedience to their lord and master.</p>

<p>As the distance is very great between
Kouan-chih-lih and Toun-cheh-ouh we left
as early as two in the morning. On leaving
Nang-kao we left the mountains also, to enter
on the plains of Pekin. The country, therefore,
was not what would be called picturesque,
but it was so well cultivated, so green, so well
wooded with fine trees, so cool, from the
numerous canals cutting it in every direction,
that I was never tired of regarding it, and the
sight was all the more grateful to my eyes
after the perpetual snow of Siberia and the
monotonous desert of Mongolia, in spite of
the picturesqueness of their mountain scenery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
After having travelled over sixty <i>lies</i> we
halted a short time at Lih-choui-tziao, and then
resumed our way. We easily passed the
Chinese custom house of Tum-bah, thanks
again to the ability of M. Schévélof. Wherever
the Chinese impose a tax it is difficult to
escape it, and to the collection of taxes the
law of responsibility extends also. The
sovereign says to the grand mandarins, “I
want so much money from your government.”
The grand mandarin says to his subordinate,
“I want so much from your province,” taking
care to double the sum for security. The
mandarin of the second class exacts the same
from the mandarin of the third class, in each
case doubling through precaution; and the
mandarin of the third class announces to his
district that he must raise such and such a
tax, again doubled no doubt through being
over zealous.</p>

<p>Such an organisation doubtlessly is burdensome
to the tax-payer, but since so much is
extracted, this is precisely what seems to me
an incontestable proof of the great riches of
this country. In spite of these abuses, misery
and destitution are apparently not very prevalent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
During the whole of my sojourn in
China, there were hardly eight or ten who
came to me begging, whilst in Egypt, a country
reputed rich, one is constantly assailed with
packs of beggars dinning in one’s ears:
“Backsheesh,” “chavaga.”</p>

<p>It was about four in the afternoon when we
entered the immense village of Toun-cheh-ouh,
on the banks of the Peiho.</p>

<p>We were entertained at the house of a young
Chinese full of health and <i>embonpoint</i>, reminding
one a little of the exaggerated round
figure of Mr. Punch, but a thoroughly good
fellow, and one fond of good living in every
way. He served us a dinner <i>à la russe</i>, which
I found to my taste, after the detestable
<i>cuisine</i> of the Chinese cook-shop.</p>

<p>Immediately after this repast my companions
went to embark for Tien-tsin, and I accompanied
them as far as the river. On the way
M. Schévélof gave all the necessary instructions
to my host to enable him to provide for
my safe journey on the morrow to Pekin.</p>

<p>When these tea merchants arrived at the
port, they entered into one of the barges
moored to the shore, in the middle of whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
decks is raised a construction for passengers,
resembling somewhat that of the Venetian
gondola. We wished one another good-bye
and pleasant journeys, and off they went.
These merchants in departing from my sight
dropped completely the curtain between me and
the Empire of the Czars, and I turned mine eyes
from Siberia, a country over which, in spite of
its fertility and auriferous riches, a bird of prey
seemed to be continually hovering. Therefore,
on seeing the last ties that held me, though
only remotely, to this unfortunate land of
exile and sorrow cut away, I felt relieved from
an oppression, notwithstanding the singular
position in which I found myself among these
bulb-shaped Chinese. I could say nothing
whatever to my host. Even Pablo’s talent
in expressing himself in pantomime became
quite insufficient to penetrate the limited
intelligence of the Buddhist with whom I was
lodged. I could not close an eye the whole
night on account of the repeated attacks of an
army of fleas, that annoyed me with their scouts
in every quarter, drawn out probably by a
change of diet in which they revelled; and
again on account of the night watch, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
duty it was to make a row to frighten away
thieves, according to the Chinese custom,
which I first became acquainted with at
Krasnoiarsk. The next day my host could not
provide me with a palanquin before one in the
afternoon. I was, however, very glad that he
had even so far complied with the instructions
of M. Schévélof, for if he had been disposed to
keep me at his house some time, I really do not
know how I could have managed to have got
out of it again. Just as I was going away I gave
a trifle to one of the servants: the master perceiving
it called all the servants together, who
came and knelt before me and touched the
ground with their foreheads. However familiar
a European may be with Oriental manners, he
can never regard without a pang such a
spectacle of slavish humility. I jumped into
my palanquin as quickly as possible, and took
leave of my host, not in offering my hand,
which is not in accordance with Chinese custom,
but in pressing my hands together, and
moving them two or three times in a line
perpendicular to my chest. I understood, with
satisfaction, that this obliging man recommended
my mule driver to conduct me to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
French Embassy; then we started, Pablo and I,
towards the capital of the Celestial Empire.</p>

<p>Whilst I was journeying under a burning sun
over this road, covered with thick dust, in the
abominable vehicle called a palanquin, three
young horsemen, whom I shall present to the
reader, galloped by without drawing rein
between Tien-tsin and Pekin.</p>

<p>The distance is thirty-two leagues, and
they would accomplish it in a day. They
had, certainly, no time to lose. Having left
Tien-tsin at four in the morning, they had
stopped an hour in a village to breakfast and
change horses: at the time I was leaving
Toun-cheh-ouh, they had just begun the second
stage. In order to go from Paris to Pekin,
these three young French travellers had not
braved the hardships of a Siberian winter, nor
the monotony of a sledge, nor the discomfort
of a Chinese vehicle; and yet their adventures
were as interesting as mine. They had been
through India: they had been received in the
palaces of the nabobs of that country, far
more attractive I should say than those of the
gold hunters of the North: they had hunted
wild beasts in Ceylon and Java, chased the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
elephant in the virgin forests of Malacca, and
continuing their hardy course, they thought it
a mere trifle to do thirty-two leagues a day,
intending, if circumstances admitted of it, to
resume their journey at the same speed.</p>

<p>The first of these three young men&mdash;one of
my best friends, who, whilst we were travelling
a few miles apart on the plain of Pekin, I
thought was in Paris&mdash;was the Baron Benoist
Méchin; his two comrades were the Viscomte de
Gouy d’Arsy and Monsieur Guillaume Jeannel.
They arrived at the legation as I came in sight
of the fortifications of the capital of China.</p>

<p>At this sight I felt quite a glow of enthusiasm.
The longer one has had an object in view, and
the more efforts he has made to attain it, the
greater is the joy on reaching it at last. It is
difficult to find anything grander and more
boldly constructed than the first wall of Pekin.
It is a wall of imposing elevation, crenelated,
and perfectly regular. Here and there
fortresses are raised above principal gates,
rising to three or four stories, and roofed in
green porcelain, that glitters in the sun. The
gates are of bronze, and gigantic: they are
closed at night, and at certain hours of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
I did not enter the city without feeling a
thrill of emotion. I had to pass over some
irregular space scattered over with low, unsightly
habitations; then I entered into the
populous quarter; finally, under a dome of
foliage I perceived a wooden gate, elegantly
sculptured with two marble lions, above which
I could read, “Légation de France.” I had
at last accomplished my journey from Paris
to Pekin overland.</p>

<p>When I entered into the salon of M. de
Geoffroy, who was the Envoy Extraordinary
of France in China, all the <i>personnel</i> of the
legation were present to do honour to the three
young travellers I have just mentioned. I shall
never forget my entry into this hospitable
salon, where I found so much courtesy and
affability. The palace was quite an Eden. What
happy days I passed there! I slept at last
in a bed, a luxury I had not known since I
left Nijni-Novgorod: I lived <i>à la cuisine
française</i>, and I spoke French with French
people. But the reader will feel more interested
in a description of Pekin and its
people, which I shall attempt in the next and
last chapter.</p>

<span class="subhead">PEKIN&mdash;DEPARTURE.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Marble Bridge&mdash;The Tartar City&mdash;Objects of Art&mdash;Japanese
lacquering&mdash;Interments&mdash;The Observatory&mdash;The
Imperial Palace&mdash;The Temples&mdash;The four harvests&mdash;Kinds
of tea&mdash;Departure from Pekin&mdash;Tien-tsin&mdash;The
sea at last.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following day we went first to pay our
respects to Monseigneur de Laplace, the
bishop of Pekin, who was then residing at
the Mission of the Pères Lazaristes.</p>

<p>To get there we had to go over the marble
bridge, which is one of the local wonders.
This bridge rises in a saddle-back over a
pond, I might say a little lake, and this is
surrounded by the gardens of the Imperial
palace. Unfortunately, the profusion of aquatic
flowers with which this pond is so gay
during summer were not yet in bloom, still
we could, at least, admire the picturesque
view from the marble bridge.</p>

<p>Mounds undoubtedly artificial, but called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
here by the grand name of mountains, rise in
waving outline around this piece of water.
They are covered with rare trees, surmounted
with kiosks, and those little constructions
which we call pagodas. Pavilions are raised
on piles above the water. The soil is covered
with grass and creeping plants, that stretch
along the ground and fall into the lake. The
whole is delightfully cool, shady, and attractive,
and laid out with unusual refinement of taste.</p>

<p>The Mission of the Lazaristes is built in the
middle of this charming spot. All the fathers
wear the Chinese costume, and I found it odd
to call <i>Révérends Pères</i> these men in <i>papooches</i>,
and adorned with pigtails as long as those
of the Chinese: it is true their tresses are
false, or nearly all false, but they would scarcely
be supposed to be factitious unless seen very
near.</p>

<p>The finest part of Pekin is that surrounding
the palace: it is known by the name of the
Tartar city. The great merchants and the
most famous dealers in curiosities live here,
and carry on their business as well.</p>

<p>The houses have simply a ground floor and
no other storey; but their façades in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
streets are of wood sculptured and gilt. The
thickness of the ornamentation is considerable,
and the carvings are sunk into it with a
delicacy quite Chinese in its way. I do not
know what one of these house fronts would
be worth in France. Let the reader fancy a
whole street lined with such shops glittering
with gilding under a brilliant sky, and revealing,
tastefully disposed in their interiors,
embellished with these rich frames, all the
wonders of Asiatic fairy-land.</p>

<p>I am sorry to be obliged here to undeceive,
perhaps, my readers with regard to the fine
Chinese collections which they imagine they
possess at home. I am far from saying there
are not in Europe admirable specimens of
Chinese art. But, generally, all the articles
offered for sale in England and France come
from the southern cities, from Canton, Hong
Kong, and Shanghai, and consequently are
the productions of second-rate makers. Pekin
art is almost everywhere still unknown, and
it will easily be understood why it should be
so, when it is remembered that Europeans
are not allowed to carry on business in the
capital of the Celestial Empire. Our last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
expeditions have not procured us any more
liberty in this respect. The specimens of the
art of Pekin are, therefore, almost exclusively
bought by tourists on their visits, who do not
dispose of them by way of trade. There may
be seen in France, it is true, enamels in
cloisonné work, but they give no idea of the
marvels of the kind of work tourists may
admire in the temple of Pekin. But there are
entire panels much less known, representing
landscapes, produced by the application of
lacquer to porcelain; screens, wherein dyed
ivory is applied to open-carved woodwork;
or lacquered folding screens with ornamentation
produced by the coloured transparent
stones of Mongolia. The latter kind of work
presents objects of incomparable beauty, and
one is never tired of admiring them. There
are also vases in uniform enamel, generally
blue with designs in white, level with the
surface, having a most graceful effect. This
kind of vase is not rare at Pekin, and yet
very little known in Europe.</p>

<p>Whilst I am describing the art of the
extreme East, I should like to enlighten the
reader a little on Japanese lacquers, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
I intend drawing my notes of travel to a close
at Tien-tsin, and to say nothing of those
Japan islands&mdash;a sojourn dear as a souvenir
of pleasure and joy. All the productions to
which we in France give this pompous title
of <i>laque au Japon</i>, consist merely of surfaces
of varnished wood. In the true lacquer, on
the contrary, the drawings in bold relief are
composed of pure gold, and the ground-work
is covered with adventurine reduced to a
powder before application. Objects in true
lacquer command therefore, in Japan, exorbitant
prices.</p>

<p>I one day asked at Yeddo the price of a
cabinet resembling pretty much those that
are become now so common in France, and
are generally sold with us for two or three
hundred francs. The dealer demanded twenty-five
thousand francs for it. A little square
box of about four inches each way, of genuine
lacquer, is worth, in Japan, from eight hundred
to one thousand francs. I shall not enter into
the subject of Chinese porcelain, because this
alone would form matter for a volume: besides,
I did not remain long enough at Pekin to
become well acquainted with this delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
department of Chinese art, more difficult to
master. I will simply mention two kinds of
vases in porcelain which appeared to me
much esteemed. The one sort is ornamented
with large Chinese figures, having in the
middle a medallion representing some scene
in character with the surroundings. The
other is covered with designs in bold relief,
also of porcelain, and coloured. These two
kinds of vases, it seems, originated three or
four hundred years ago, and are worth generally
from four to seven hundred francs.
What are known also as pretty little thin
cloisonné enamels, date also from about the
same epoch, and fetch considerable prices in
China. These cloisonné enamels are rather
rare in Europe. They may be recognised by
their designs being more sunk and less regular
than in those relatively modern, and
especially by certain parts of them, where the
transparency of the enamel permits the copper
on which it is laid to be seen beneath.</p>

<p>As I have just mentioned, the streets of the
Tartar quarter are lined with shops, exposing
in their fronts the beautiful articles just
described. In the roadway the throng of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
people is even greater than in the villages I
had passed through.</p>

<p>The crowds of people on foot are obliged
to stand aside constantly to make way for
the palanquins of the grandees, borne by men;
the two-wheeled carriages of the mandarins,
who may be seen through the black or green
<i>persiennes</i>, wrapped in their long robes of
embroidered silk; the horses, the camels, the
travelling palanquins with mules, then the
marriage and funeral processions. The
latter occupy a considerable space, and stretch
over five hundred or a thousand yards, according
to the dignity of the deceased. The poor
carry in the line of procession parasols, poles
surmounted with hands in gilt wood, and all
kinds of amulets. Then follow the objects that
belonged to the defunct; his horse, his
carriage, in which is generally set up an
effigy in wax representing his features, and if
a mandarin, wearing his court costume. At
last is seen the coffin, made of oak about two
and a half inches thick, and placed on a
catafalque. The great bier is borne by at
least forty or sixty men. The relatives
dressed in white, the mark of mourning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
precede the coffin, throwing flowers in the
way, burning incense, and going through a
ceremony of respect to the dead every eighty
or hundred steps. For this demonstration the
procession comes to a halt. They spread on
the ground a white cloth, and the mourners,
prostrating themselves entirely face downwards,
strike their foreheads, on the ground.
This part of the ceremony finished, they get
up and the procession proceeds, with these
interludes, to some land belonging to the
deceased, where the coffin is deposited on the
ground in the open air and left there without
burial. When the coffin decays they form a
tumulus of earth around it, but it is never
put into a grave. The spot remains ever
afterwards sacred, and can be used no more
for cultivation.</p>

<p>It may be imagined what an immense
extent of valuable land the Chinese lose
through this custom. It is known what many
quarrels it also leads to in the towns along
the coast inhabited by Europeans: the subject
has been too often discussed to make it worth
while to say anything about it here.</p>

<p>Among the great concourse of people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
the Tartar city may be seen a multitude of
conjurers exercising their wonderful feats in
the open air.</p>

<p>Their dexterity is surprising; for they
execute their tricks among the spectators
without the convenient aid of tables and boxes
with false bottoms, which are such valuable
adjuncts in theatres. Some of them perform
even dangerous feats: they leap head-foremost
through a cylinder placed horizontally, bristling
with nails and pointed blades. I should never
come to an end if I were to describe everything
that obtrudes itself on the sight in
these wide streets of the Tartar city. Nowhere
else can be seen such a varied and picturesque
kaleidoscope as here meets the astonished
eye.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, side by side with these
marvels, one turns with disgust from other
sights repulsive to European civilization. All
along the streets vast holes are sunk for a
purpose it would be embarrassing to explain.
There is no city in the world so noisome, and
I can easily understand why the <i>personnel</i> of
the legations prefer remaining shut up four
and five months at a time in their fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
residences and grounds, to seeking any recreation
in such a polluted atmosphere.</p>

<p>We visited the observatory, constructed by
the Chinese under the direction of the Jesuits.
The scientific instruments to be seen there
are admirable. They are made of bronze,
supported on feet of the same metal, in which
all the fancies of Chinese art have been
lavished. The contortions of these mountings,
composed of dragons and grotesque
monsters, produce a striking contrast to the
regular forms of the spheres, the parallel lines
and astronomical figures which they sustain
at a great height in the air.</p>

<p>I have seen at Pekin, in the temples of the
Mongolian lamas, or of the priests of Buddha,
splendid enamels and objects of great value;
but I have never found in China, nor even
in Japan, where bronze is, certainly, turned
to better account than in the Celestial
Empire, anything so artistic, in the strict
meaning of the term, as the apparatus of this
observatory. The taste of the Chinese it
must be admitted is very questionable. One
may admire, especially, the colours of their
porcelain, the soft hues of their ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
enamels, and the harmony of the tints in
their embroidered stuffs; but in their designs,
in the forms of their objects and personages,
many faults and even repulsive monstrosities
may be noticed. But the instruments of the
Pekin Observatory are, in my opinion, above
all criticism. Fancifulness certainly abounds
therein, but it is only within just bounds:
the supports I have just mentioned are so
slender, so delicately worked, that they seem
quite foreign and distinct from the spheres
they sustain, and these indeed produce the
illusion of being maintained by their proper
force like real celestial worlds.</p>

<p>Before quitting this spot I took from the
top a panoramic view of this immense capital,
and the prospect extended over a considerable
distance. The golden roofs of the merchants’
houses of the Tartar city were glittering
with splendour in the sun; then I remarked
the not less brilliant green porcelain roofs of
the fortresses rising above the chief gates,
the blue porcelain roofs of the pagodas, of
the Temple of Heaven, and of the Temple
of Agriculture, and then, particularly, the
Imperial palace, covered with yellow porcelain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
The Imperial palace of China is the abode
of mystery; a mystery no one can boast of
having penetrated. It is a little spot, unknown
and deserted, amid these teeming
millions of human beings&mdash;a recess into which
no European has ever entered, and wherein
only a very limited number of Chinese can
penetrate once in the twenty-four hours, and
then only in the darkest hours of the night.</p>

<p>The audience which the Emperor gave a
few years ago to the European ministers, and
which made a considerable sensation, did not
take place even in the palace. The Son of
Heaven did not deign to show himself here to
the ministers but in a pavilion so far removed
from the mysterious palace that it is plainly
visible from the marble bridge.</p>

<p>Many reports have circulated in Europe
regarding the private life of the Emperors of
China, and the internal regulations of the
palace. M. Berthémy, the French minister in
Japan, whom I had the honour to meet at
Yokohama, and who had previously been in
China for many years, said: “All that has
been retailed about the interior of the Imperial
palace of Pekin can only be a mere fable, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
it is impossible for anyone to know anything
about it. The only thing that seems to me
likely, because it has been declared to me by
all the mandarins, is that the Emperor is
subjected to a severe etiquette, and that he
would be immediately assassinated by his own
guards if he attempted to set it aside.”</p>

<p>The sight of the yellow roofs of this palace
produced on me a deep impression, and on
reposing at my ease at the Embassy I compared
in my mind the existence of this poor
Emperor, a slave to etiquette, to our good
king Saint Louis showing himself to his
people and administering justice under an oak
in the Bois de Vincennes. How many unhappy
there are in this world in all the scales
of the social hierarchy!</p>

<p>I shall say little of the Temple of Heaven,
and of the Temple of Agriculture, because
they are not interesting. The first especially
is unworthy of the exalted name it bears. It
is in an immense park surrounded with walls,
in which chapels and pretty pavilions, covered
with blue porcelain, are distributed, and where
a subdued light penetrates through blinds
composed of little tubes of blue glass placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
parallel. A platform of white marble is raised
in the middle of the park, and it is here the
Emperor occasionally comes to offer with his
own hand sacrifices to the Divinity.</p>

<p>The curious portion of the Temple of Agriculture
and its precincts is a field where, every
year, on a certain day, the Emperor, holding
in his hand a plough, makes a furrow along
the ground, as if to give an example to his
subjects. The remainder of the field is afterwards
ploughed by the mandarins. This
ceremony shows how much agriculture, the
principal source of the wealth of the country,
is honoured in China. With their two annual
harvests of corn, the Chinese succeed in providing
bread at a moderate price, and by
exporting their tea and their rice they draw
gold into their country from all parts of the
world. Their method of cultivation very much
resembles the Egyptian system. They divide
their fields into little squares, around which
water is conducted for irrigation to all parts.
This water flows from numerous canals winding
through the country, and is supplied by
contrivances worked by Chinese labourers like
the Egyptian <i>shadoufs</i>. For the cultivation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
rice the little squares are surrounded with an
embankment high enough to maintain over
the field a sheet of water several inches deep.
The land thus disappears completely. When
I visited the rice fields in the month of May,
the seed, lately sown, hardly sprouted above
the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The tea is a little shrub, a foot and a half
to two feet high. The leaves are gathered
from May to August, according to the species,
and also according to the quality required.
There are in China growths of tea as there
are in France growths of wine. The nature
of the soil and the different kinds of plants
produce the varieties known to the trade.
The most esteemed kind is known by the name
of yellow tea. It is the ordinary drink of the
Emperor of China and the Emperor of Russia.</p>

<p>This tea is so valuable, that in Siberia, in
certain even rich families, I have sometimes
seen one cup of it only made in my honour,
whilst my hosts deprived themselves of it by
reason of economy. It would not be interesting
here to enumerate the different growths,
because they are not known by their original
names. The various kinds are named in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
France according to the mode of gathering:
thus pearl tea is from small leaves gathered
at the beginning of spring, soon after their
formation. The <i>thé à pointes blanches</i> is made
of a mixture of leaves and flowers. The white
points are merely the dried flowers of the
shrub; this is the reason this kind is the
strongest. One of the commonest kinds is the
brick tea, which I have already mentioned as
serving for money in Mongolia; and finally
the commonest tea, which through some preparation
I am ignorant of presents an odd
appearance. It has also the form of a brick,
but it is quite black, and neither a stalk nor a
leaf can be seen in it, as in the other bricks.
On looking at it, it might be supposed to be
a block of coal or peat. This tea is sold for
a mere trifle, and is a great resource for the
poor of Siberia as well as China.</p>

<p>The intelligence and skilfulness of the
Chinese are everywhere apparent, and they
know how to turn these advantages to account
in everything. They have also brought to
great perfection the art of sail-making. I am
not acquainted with all the systems adopted in
France, but in mentioning the lateen sail (<i>la voile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
latine</i>), which bears the name of our race, I mention,
I believe, one of the inventions of Europe.
But this lateen sail in swelling out excessively
under the action of the wind does not at the
same time utilize all the force this moving
power is capable of imparting. Besides, in
squalls, the handling consists in slackening the
rope that ties it below. The canvas flapping
then at the top of the mast imparts a pitching
or tossing to the boat that may be very
dangerous. This method of sailing is, therefore,
imperfect. The Chinese sail is, on the
contrary, held in by a series of parallel bars,
and thus constantly opposes an even surface
to the play of the wind. Then, with the aid of
a pulley at the top of the mast, it can be
lowered to any degree. In this way the
Chinese may, in the most violent squalls, still
have a sail spread that offers little, much
above the deck, for the storm to grapple with,
consequently exposing in no way the ship
to danger.</p>

<p>I might quote many examples of this ingenious
and practical mind; and in travelling
through China I have conceived the highest
opinion of the intelligence, the cleverness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
the perseverance of the Chinese. There is only
one thing wanting to these people: a government
that will let them know there are other nations
in the world besides the Chinese; that these
nations have also a civilization, from which it
would be judicious and especially profitable
to borrow certain inventions. But the day will
come, and perhaps it is not afar, when the
Chinese will immigrate into Europe, as they
already immigrate into Japan, California, and
Peru; they will form at Marseilles, Paris, and
London more important quarters than the
depôts of Shanghai, Macao, and Saigon, and
foreign commerce will take an expansion
unknown with this nation.</p>

<p>The majority of the French people believe
the intelligence of the Japanese is very superior
to that of the Chinese. It is a serious mistake.
The Japanese resemble us very much in their
character, and that is the reason this people
pleases travellers. They are gay, enterprising,
boastful, disputative, and a little revolutionary.
There is in Japan an actual pretender, and
consequently among the Japanese partisans of
such and such a family, and, perhaps, even
republicans more or less democratic or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
socialistic. The French, therefore, like the
Japanese, and on the other hand the Japanese
admire the French. They create a little army
in which they adopt our costumes; nothing
is more singular than to see a <i>chasseur de
Vincennes</i> mounting guard in the streets of
Yeddo. They construct little railways, little
telegraphs; but in the end these things are not
serious, because in the first place there is not,
nor can be, anything serious in these people;
these applications of our inventions are insignificant
because they are confined to a little
tongue of land very narrow along the sea,
beyond which it is impossible for Europeans to
penetrate. The interior of Japan is absolutely
closed to us, whilst we are perfectly free to
travel from one end of China to the other.
It is, therefore, I consider, quite an error to
suppose that Japan is marching towards civilization.
The existing transformations are
limited to a very minute portion of the territory,
and consequently have no significance.</p>

<p>The Chinese government does not permit
to its people either telegraphs or railways, or
anything that is European; but the day when
the Chinese, through some much desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
revolution, will have obtained these concessions
from its government, it will not only apply our
inventions with judgment but will perfect them,
and perhaps we shall be astonished one fine
day to learn from the Chinese the means of
uniting on railways the highest speed with the
greatest security. To impose on the Chinese
a new form of government, or on the existing
government a new constitution, is what our
last expedition there should have taken in
hand, instead of destroying the Summer
Palace, a piece of work repugnant to my
feelings to dwell on.</p>

<p>A little lake, surrounded entirely with marble
galleries and covered with miniature islands, in
the middle of which are displayed the most
charming pavilions in the world; a large range
of steps in porcelain, rising to the top of the
hill of Wan-tcho-chan, and two little temples in
porcelain,&mdash;these are the remains of the marvels
that once astonished the wondering sight in
this palace and surrounding park.</p>

<p>I took leave of my kind hosts at the Legation
of Pekin, whose hospitality and attentions I
shall never forget, on the 18th of May, and
went to Tien-tsin by the course of the Peiho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
M. Rystel, then at the Consulate of Tien-tsin,
entertained us very agreeably the time we
were obliged to wait for a boat, and at last, on
the 24th of May, I embarked for Shanghai
with my three young companions already
mentioned. I could not make up my mind to
leave Pablo at Tien-tsin, and I, therefore, took
him with me. The poor fellow was so faithful
and devoted, and never ceased expatiating with
tears in his eyes on the <i>far niente</i> life he had
enjoyed, with so much good living, at the
Embassy of Pekin. On going to sea at the
mouth of the Peiho I was overcome with
rapture. For this great sea is all one, and, in
washing the shores of every land it touches,
it brought me nearer to my native land; its
waves caressed as lovingly the beaches of
Trouville and Biarritz as the cliffs of the gulf
of Pei-Chi-Li.</p>

<p>My fatiguing travels over the Siberian
steppes and the Desert of Gobi were decidedly
at an end, and I now had before me the
prospect of my friends and my home.</p>

<p>My readers, perhaps, will wonder what
could have induced me to have undertaken
so wearisome a journey: I had imagined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
bright side of it only then, but now I have seen
the other I can advise them not to follow my
example; for though there are many novel,
grand, and striking scenes of nature, accompanied
with much exciting adventure, still
they are not to be enjoyed in so rigorous a
climate as that of Siberia in Winter without
incurring much hardship, and even a certain
exposure to a considerable share of danger.</p>

<p>Whenever the degree of temperature is mentioned in the
course of this narrative, it is according to the <i>Centigrade
scale</i>, although it is calculated by the Réaumur thermometer,
and no other, in Russia. 5° Centigrade are equal to 9°
Fahrenheit: but since the freezing point in the Centigrade
thermometer is 0, and in the Fahrenheit 32°, in converting
one scale into the other, care must be taken to add or deduct
this difference in calculating above or below freezing point.
It will therefore be seen that when 18° below 0 in the Centigrade
scale are reached&mdash;a point nearly equivalent to zero
in the Fahrenheit thermometer&mdash;the latter is quite inadequate
to indicate the intense cold of Siberia, where, in certain parts,
as at Yakutsk and Tomsk, it is said to reach 58° Centigrade
even, in some winters. This temperature would be equivalent
to 105° Fahrenheit below freezing point, disregarding the
irrational descending scale below this mark, and supposing
the graduation to continue instead from freezing point with
augmenting numbers. But Gabriel Fahrenheit contrived his
thermometer for Dantzig, and evidently not for Siberia; for
the lowest point, zero, has no scientific basis, no significance
whatever in the phenomena of heat, and represents merely the
extreme cold registered at Dantzig in 1709, a degree of cold
which must have been surpassed there subsequently by many
degrees, and even in Paris by at least 15°, once in the winter
of 1871 during the siege, and more than once during the
rigorous winter of 1880. We seem to be more attached to this
Dantzig thermometer than the Dantzigians themselves, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
probably, have long ago adopted the more rational scale of
Réaumur or of Celsius, more rational at least so far as they
are graduated each way from freezing point. Perhaps a
change may come about when we begin to dine at 18 o’clock
instead of 6 p.m.&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<h3 id="note_2"><span class="smcap">Note 2, Chap. VII., <a href="#Page_127">Page 127</a>.</span></h3>

<p>Siberia, it appears, judging from an account of a correspondent
of the <i>Times</i> at Tumen, published November 20th,
1883, is quite <i>un pays de cocagne</i>, so far as provisions are
concerned, sparkling champagne of course excepted. The
prices of some articles of food at Tumen are given as follows:</p>

<p>“Geese in autumn cost fivepence a pair, and are frozen in
numbers to be sent west to Russia and east to Irkutsk; grouse
in summer, being a delicacy, cost threepence a pair, and good
fish, such as sterlet and nelma, from three-halfpence to twopence-halfpenny
per pound. Sheep are scarce and not much
eaten, but beef in autumn costs from fifteen to twenty pence
the pood, or about a halfpenny per pound.”</p>

<p>In spite of the cheapness of provisions and labour, travelling
appears to be, at least to the foreigner, very expensive in
Siberia.&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<h3 id="note_3"><span class="smcap">Note 3, Chap. IX., <a href="#Page_165">Page 165</a>.</span></h3>

<p>Some interesting experiments on seeds and plants have recently
been made by a Norwegian <i>savant</i>, Professor Schubeler,
with the view of demonstrating the beneficial influence of prolonged
sunlight on vegetation during the long summer days
of the north. Some of these experiments were as follows:
dwarf beans taken from Christiania to Drontheim, being less
than 4° further north, gained more than 60 per cent. in weight;
thyme brought from Lyons and planted at Drontheim gained
71 per cent. It appears that the grain grown in northern
latitudes is much heavier than that grown in more southern
lands: on the other hand, seed taken from Norway and sown
at Bresslau greatly diminished in weight the first year. As
the differences of soil, moisture, temperature of the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
and air, and other disturbing elements have to be duly accounted
for, these experiments do not appear to be sufficient
to establish the fact that the increase of weight was <i>wholly</i>
due to increased sunlight. Perhaps experiments for comparative
results will be made under similar conditions, except
those of the duration and quantity of sunlight, and such
experiments, more in accordance with the principles of experimental
science, would, if made, be more satisfactory.&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>It does not appear, however, that wolves are always so
peaceful and harmless. From a police report it seems that,
in 1875, 161 persons, and domestic animals to the value of
£2,500,000, were killed by wolves in European Russia: their
depredations in Siberia could not probably be easily calculated.
In 1882 it is reported that 278 human beings were
killed by wolves in British India.&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>The following are a few clauses from the Russian penal
code that came into operation on the 1st of May, 1846, and
will show how far religious intolerance is carried in Russia.
Certain clauses relating to corporal punishments, the abrogation
of privileges, and the right of suzerainty are omitted,
because the decree emancipating the serfs renders them null
and void.</p>

<p>“Sec. 196.&mdash;He who abandons the orthodox faith for any
other creed, Christian even, is to be handed over to the
ecclesiastical authorities, in order to be admonished and
enlightened, and that his case may be judged according to
the rules of the Church. Until he returns to the orthodox
faith, the Government <i>takes steps</i> to preserve his children,
under age, from corruption: a guardian is placed over his
estates, and <i>he is forbidden to reside there</i>.”</p>

<p>“Sec. 197.&mdash;He who shall attempt, either by word of mouth
or writing, to draw orthodox believers into another creed,
shall be condemned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
“For the first offence, to be imprisoned for one year or two
years in a house of correction; for the second, to be incarcerated
in a fortress for a period of four to six years; for the
third, to be sent into exile in the government of Tobolsk or
Tomsk, with imprisonment for one or two years.”</p>

<p>“Sec. 198.&mdash;If the parents, who are legally obliged to
bring up their children in the orthodox faith, shall bring
them up according to the practices of some other creed,
Christian even, they shall be condemned to imprisonment
for one or two years; their children shall be entrusted to
parents of the orthodox faith for their education, or in
default of such persons, to guardians nominated by the
Government.”</p>

<p>“Sec. 199.&mdash;He who shall hinder anyone from following
the orthodox faith shall be condemned to be imprisoned for
three to six months: and if he shall have used threats or
violence or practised annoyance, he shall be confined for two
or three years in a house of correction.”</p>

<p>“Sec. 200.&mdash;He who is well aware that his wife or his
children, or any persons legally under his <i>surveillance</i>, intend
to abandon the orthodox creed, and does not attempt
to dissuade them from it, or take such measures as are
authorised by the law to prevent them from doing so, shall
be liable to an imprisonment of three days to three months;
and if he is orthodox, he shall be subject to ecclesiastical
punishment.”</p>

<p>This law therefore obliges a man, <i>even if he is a Roman
Catholic</i>, to denounce his wife and children of the orthodox
faith and act with rigour against them.</p>

<p>“Sec. 202.&mdash;Members of the clergy of the Christian sects,
convicted of having taught the Catechism to orthodox children,
<i>although it should not be proved</i> that they intended to beguile
them, will be liable: for the first offence, to be removed
from their spiritual charge for one to three years; for the
second, to forfeit entirely their charge, and, after having been
imprisoned for one to two years, to be placed continually
under the <i>surveillance</i> of the police.”</p>

With regard to the grave question of mixed marriages, the
tenth book of the laws, among other vexatious regulations,
stipulates that: “If one of the two contracting parties is
orthodox, the priest can only give his benediction to the
marriage when he shall have obtained from the heterodox
party a formal engagement in writing, that he or she shall
not attempt to gain over the other to his or her religion by
allurements, threats, or other means, and that <i>all their
children shall be brought up in the orthodox faith</i>.”</p>

<p>Marriages between members of the Catholic and of the
Orthodox faith, celebrated only in a Catholic church, are declared
null and void.</p>

<p>In Siberia, poor people, who travel enormous distances
afoot, in order to pray at a tomb or the image of a saint,
are often met with. It is not a rare occurrence for peasants

<p>Many Siberian animals that are white during winter, resume,
in the summer, furs of a colour which we habitually see here.
The ermine is a changeable fur, and becomes yellow during
the warm season. A summer ermine is almost worthless in

<p>“A common Indian and Sumatran butterfly (<i>Kallima</i>)
disappears like magic when it settles in a bush; for it hides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
its head and antennæ between its closed wings, and these in
form, <i>colour</i>, and veining, <i>cannot be distinguished from a
withered leaf</i> together with the footstalk.”&mdash;<i>Wallace.</i></p>

<p>“With animals of all kinds, whenever colour has been
modified <i>for some special purpose</i>, this has been, as far as
we can judge, either <i>for protection</i> or as an attraction between
the sexes.”&mdash;<i>Darwin</i>, <i>Descent of Man</i>.</p>

<p>The white furs of the animals, liable to become the prey of
others amid the snow, are obviously a protection from observation;
and likewise in summer, some other colour presenting
a diminished contrast with surrounding nature, would have
the same effect.</p>

<p>Perhaps this adaptation of colour to surroundings may extend
also to certain animals, which would otherwise become
extinct if they did not enjoy the facilities it conferred in the
capture of their prey when they are placed at a great disadvantage.
The Polar bear, for instance, requires no protection
from its enemies, but favourable conditions, probably, for
approaching its prey unobserved. It seems reasonable to
conclude that animals of either class favoured with a colour
that enables them either to escape from their pursuers, or,
on the other hand, to approach their prey, have, in the
struggle for life, the best chance of a prolonged existence,
and consequently of leaving the most numerous offspring to
perpetuate the race. Though colour is one of the most varying
features of animals, it is, whether changing or permanent,
beginning to be recognised no longer as capricious or accidental,
as we have hitherto usually regarded it, but as the
consequence of the survival of the most highly favoured in an
endowment conducive to the preservation of the species, a
discovery on which the continued observations of naturalists
are ever throwing fresh light.&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>In England, in the time of Henry VIII., Sable was
probably adopted by wealthy people as a distinctive mark
of their social position; otherwise, why should it have become
an object of legislation and have been prohibited by the
Statute of Apparel (24 Hen. VIII.) to be worn by any under
the degree of an earl?</p>

<p>It will, no doubt, be seen from this diverse and often
singularly-extravagant appreciation of furs in Russia&mdash;and
occasionally not so much for their beauty and elegance as
for their rarity and great money value&mdash;that it is the lucky
possessors who are admired and envied in these luxuries,
because they are the means of proclaiming and parading so
effectively their opulence; and the vain, exulting in this
special homage to their exaggerated self-importance, cheerfully
buy the gratification at their own appraisement, and
thereby give to these furs an exorbitant value.</p>

<p>It might be contended that a single caprice of this nature
is insufficient to prove the existence of a passion for the display
of wealth, and that such instances must necessarily be rare
because the furs are rare.</p>

<p>But it has significance enough to deduce from it its pervading
character. The vain, it is true, can be vain only of what they
possess; but to suppose these to have undivided possession of
the folly, as well as exclusive enjoyment of the highly-prized
furs, would be to take no account of the admiring multitude
and the envious, without whom the vanity of others would
clearly have no <i>raison d’être</i>&mdash;no visible existence; for the
price of these special badges or symbols, these admirers, the
public in fact, so materially sustain, is precisely the measure
of the public estimation.</p>

<p>It seems therefore reasonable to infer that the sentiment is
general.</p>

<p>Then when a caprice becomes <i>à la mode</i>&mdash;“the proper thing
to do”&mdash;a powerful fresh stimulus is added to the folly, and
the feverish desire “to be in the fashion” may develop the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
passion into a mania, whether its special objects be badges
of wealth, bibelots, tulips, or bric-à-brac, and</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Thus does a false ambition rule us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus pomp delude and folly fool us.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But a desire to fall in with the fashion would alone be insufficient
to explain the extraordinary price of blue fox feet fur;
for a fashion to become a rage must first take the form of an
epidemic&mdash;a condition rigorously excluded by the very restricted
number of possible possessors of the coveted object. And so
far as beauty is concerned, however beautiful this fur may be,
its beauty would still far less account for the price. That the
Russians consider it beautiful, is likely enough, for beauty to
most people is purely conventional, and much more readily
perceived through the ears than the eyes. Few, perhaps,
would contend that the beauty of pearls and diamonds is at
all commensurate with their price, and yet those who recognise
the exaggeration, might not readily perceive that nearly
all their value is derived from the esteem they command as
badges or insignia of wealth and competence. If beauty has
no objective existence&mdash;and there is no evidence that it has
any other than as a sentiment or idea&mdash;it can have no money
value at all in a beautiful object, simply because it is not there,
but in the brain of the beholder; and this would, perhaps,
explain why so many seem insensible to its influence, and
again, why it appeared to Goethe to elude the grasp of definition.
How often we vainly imagine we secure it in acquiring
some charming <i>tableau de genre</i> or bit of old china, some
rare gem or inimitable enamel, and, at the end of a few
months’ familiarity with it, are disappointed at finding that it
no longer rouses the enthusiasm we felt on first beholding its
wondrous beauty! And yet, ever fondly clinging to the illusion
that it is an intrinsic part of the object, we continue the pursuit
like the chase of the beautiful blue-winged butterfly of Kashmeer,
described in <i>The Giaour</i>, and not rarely find at last
<span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>But it exists only in the mind, which feels no satisfaction
in the constant indulgence of a single emotion, and it may,
as in pearls and diamonds, be enjoyed for itself alone, without
material possession, as gratuitously as the surpassing beauty
of a splendid sunset. Nor would, perhaps, the exigencies of
fashion&mdash;which may be fully met by imitations so deceptive
as to elude ordinary detection&mdash;raise the price of the real
much beyond the fictitious gem, unless the fashionable were
as scrupulous as ladies were in the reign of Elizabeth, who,
according to Fuller, “would have as patiently digested a lie,
as the wearing of false stones or pendants of counterfeit pearl.”</p>

<p>But regarded as insignia of wealth, possession is a <i>sine
quâ non</i>, and the extravagant price is essential to its object,
and the more extravagant it is, the higher the gratification to
be derived from it, because this implies increased distinction&mdash;the
consequence of fewer enjoying a superfluity of wealth.
The desire also to acquire a beautiful article of exaggerated
value is independent of an appreciation of beauty <i>per se</i>,
and is principally a purely factitious desire, varying for no
better reason than because other people in general by a tacit
consensus think more or less of it; and if society should <i>agree
to think</i> any object, whether beautiful or not, a convenient
vehicle to attract attention to any quality it values, such as
wealth, refinement, <i>haut ton</i>, elegance, or culture, a <i>new value</i>
is immediately given to such object, which the rage to acquire
may exaggerate to outrageous extravagance. If, for instance,
diamonds and pearls had not been taken into favour by princes,
from time immemorial all the world over, they might not now,
perhaps, have a much higher value than Brighton pebbles or
Whitby jet. And if blue fox feet fur had not been adopted
by the Muscovite grandees, it might have no higher value than
grey fox or squirrel. But it is plainly envy and admiration of
riches that the Russian grandees buy, and when they have
a relish for the luxury they pay for it as munificently as
Lucullus paid for a magnificent supper, who probably thought
as little of the epicurean gratification to be got out of a dish
of peacock’s brains, as these nabobs think of the comfort or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
elegance to be got out of a cloak of blue fox feet, the sentimental
value of which they estimate at the rate of sixteen
hundred pounds sterling!&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>The author of “Chto dyelat” was Tschernishevsky, who
wrote it in the Petro-Paolovsky fortress at St. Petersburg.
He had written also several romances during his imprisonment,
all of which he had burnt with his own hand. According
to his own statement, it does not appear that he was
imprisoned on account of anything he had written. In the
month of December, 1883, he was living as a free convict
under surveillance at Astrachan, and on the 11th of this
month, had completed his long term of nearly twenty years
of banishment. He gave the following account of his treatment
as a prisoner to a correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>,
whose interesting letter regarding him was published in that
journal, December 22nd, 1883.</p>

<p>“I was always treated by the agents of the Government as
respectfully as any man could desire. My treatment was not
that of a convict, but, throughout, that of a prisoner of war.
The hard labour, of which I have spoken, was for me, as well
as for many of the Russian and Polish political exiles, among
whom my lot was cast, a name only&mdash;it existed on paper, but
had no reality.”&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>The reader perhaps may not know why, in mentioning the
names of certain persons, their family names are preceded
by two baptismal names. It is because in Russia courtesy
demands that, in addressing anyone, you should add the
baptismal name of his father, to which is affixed the termination
<i>ovitch</i>. Thus Iwan Michäelovitch Nemptchinof means
Iwan the son of Michael Nemptchinof. This double appellation,
not merely polite, but indeed the most respectful of all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
especially when the family name is not added, is so rigorously
exacted by usage, that the Emperor, in the public acts, is
designated Alexander Nicolaevitch. It is one of the grossest
insults to address anyone by his sole baptismal name as we are
accustomed to do in our intimacies: it seems that in omitting
the name of the father in addressing a Russian you would
insinuate that he was obscure and unknown and of illegitimate
birth.</p>

<p>The depressing effect on the mind of the traveller, produced
by the aspect of monotonous scenery, has been noticed by M.
Gabriel Charmes, in an excursion in the Auvergne (<i>Journal
des Débats</i>, July, 1881), who attributes the habitual lowness
of spirits of the peasantry to the cheerless uniformity of certain
parts of the Cantal, amid which they dwell. As some of these
are said to become sorcerers from the prolonged effect, may
not the gloomy character of the Mongolian religion be largely
attributable to the dismal baldness of their desert? M. Gabriel
Charmes thus describes the mountains of the Cantal and their
influence on the mind of the spectator: “I have referred to
those great, sterile, melancholy table-lands, that are everywhere
met with in the Cantal and the mountainous district of
the Puy-de-Dôme. In the spring even, when the long grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
is mingled with an abundance of flowers, it is almost impossible
to traverse them, and quite impossible to dwell there,
without feeling some vague, unaccountable weight or oppression
on the spirits, similar to that experienced by those who
live on the sea-shore, in sight of the incessant monotony of
the waves. The clouds depict on them great dark shadows,
which, driven on by a brisk wind, flit past like gigantic phantoms.
This perpetual play of shadows and light is the only
diversity that arrests the eye in the interminable uniformity.
They, therefore, who frequent them a long while, acquire, in
course of time, strange habits of mind. It is a very widely
spread opinion among the peasantry of the Auvergne, that
the cow-herds, who pass most of the year on the lonely hills,
actually become wizards. The special fixedness, perhaps,
which the contemplation of an unvarying nature stamps on
their sight, is the cause of this prejudice.... The mind
contracts there a kind of natural melancholy, and this seems
to dispose it to sadness rather than joyousness.” It is not
probable that the monotony of the waves produces the same
effect, for here we have movement, with which the mind
sympathises, and, being thus relieved, does not readily become
a prey to melancholy. The sea is very different from
the motionless, unchanging desert.&mdash;W.&nbsp;C.</p>
